Dao De Jing by Lao Zi
A Minimalist Translation
By Bruce R. Linnell, PhD
2015
Welcome to yet another translation of the Dao De Jing (DDJ),
or Tao Te Ching in the old-fashioned spelling.  Why should you want to read
this translation?  This version attempts to include an exact translation
of every Chinese symbol in the original text, with as few added words and
paraphrasing as possible.  This results in sentences which hopefully
provide a more literal translation, but are bare and minimalist, sometimes
awkward, and often doesn’t make sense.  You, the reader, will have to
wrestle with some sentences, trying to wring out of them whatever meaning their
author was trying to express 2300 years ago, instead of my simply telling you
what I think they mean.  I also show you what words were translated
exactly, what was interpreted, and what was added or left out, so you can see
exactly how much the English translation has in common with the original
Chinese.  I even point out alternative translations, so you can choose for
yourself in some cases.
Another difference is that while this translation is
primarily based on the “Wang Bi” ancient manuscript (used by most translators),
it presents some of the ideas from the earliest versions of the DDJ we have
available, if those ideas are present in the majority of all the sources.
Finally, scholars have long speculated that different parts
of the DDJ were written by different authors at different times.  By
analyzing the symbols, phrases, and themes in each chapter, the chapters can be
separated into at least three groups.  The appendix presents the chapters
in these groups, so that the reader may better see the common themes each group
focused on.
==============================================================
Who Wrote the DDJ
and When?
There is a great deal of debate over these questions, enough
to fill a book in their own right!  What follows is just a very brief
introduction for the first-time reader who has no idea who “Lao Zi” was (please
note that all dates are very approximate).
Although the author of the DDJ is always given as “Lao Zi”
or “Lao Tsu” (old spelling), we have no historical proof of his
existence.  A Chinese court historian named Sima Qian, who lived around
115 BCE, wrote a biography of Lao Zi (literally “old master”, unless Lao is a
family name – in which case “master Lao”) that presents three different
possible traditions, although the accuracy of
any
of them is
doubtful.  The first says that Lao Zi was a contemporary of Confucius (500
BCE).  His family name was Li (“plum”), his given name was Er (“ear”), and
he was posthumously called Dan (“long ear”). He was an official in the imperial
archives, but when the Zhou dynasty began to decline, he decided to leave
China.  When he reached the northwest border of China, the border guard
asked him to write down his teachings, which resulted in a document of about
5000 characters in two sections.  Later in the same document, Sima Qian
also speculates that Lao Zi may or may not have been Lao Dan (“old long ear”),
an advisor to Duke Xian (370 BCE).  Finally, Sima Qian says that a man
named Lao Laizi (“old returning master”) authored a Daoist book that had 15
parts, was born in the same province as Lao Zi, and also was a contemporary of
Confucius.  These three accounts are further complicated by reported
meetings between Confucius and someone called Lao Dan in various Confucian
texts.
References to the DDJ by other ancient Chinese writers
indicate that at least some parts of the DDJ were in existence by 300 BCE, and
it was being referred to extensively by 250 BCE.  One linguistic analysis
of the rhyme schemes indicates that it may have originated as early as 450 BCE,
and if the DDJ contains the written version of earlier oral traditions, these
rhymes may reflect its oldest origins (because rhymes are easier to
memorize).  Other references and linguistic analyses place its beginnings
around perhaps 375-325 BCE, and the earliest known written portions of it
(described in the next section) date to about 300 BCE.
So, some parts of the DDJ seem to have first appeared in
written form between roughly 350-300 BCE, although its roots could be much
older.  It certainly existed in some version of its finished form (roughly
5000 characters in 81 chapters) by 200 BCE.
There is also debate on whether the text represents the work
of mostly one author, or was added to by different authors over the course of
about a century, or was later compiled from different traditions by one
person.
The most recent versions of the DDJ are separated into 81
chapters, and two major parts.  The first part, consisting of chapters
1-37, primarily discusses Dao, while chapters 38-81 primarily discuss De. 
Ancient authors referring to the DDJ also speak of versions that are divided
into 64, 68, or 72 chapters.
==============================================================
Different Versions
of the DDJ
There are at least six different ancient sources of the text
(all dates are approximate) :
“Guodian” (GUO) – discovered in 1993 and written around 300
BCE or slightly earlier, this version matches only about 31 chapters of the
later versions of the DDJ, and its chapters are ordered completely differently
than the later versions.  The Chinese symbols are so ancient that scholars
disagree on what modern symbols they should correspond to, and there are
occasional spots on the originals where the characters can no longer be
read.
“Mawangdui” (MWD) – discovered in 1973, there are two
slightly different versions (“A” and “B”), obviously written by two different
people, dating to about 200 BCE and 175 BCE respectively.  While all 81
chapters are present, both versions reverse the two major parts (“Dao” and
“De”) compared to later versions.  In addition, the order of a few of the
chapters within the parts is different, as is the order of some sections within
the chapters!  The Chinese symbols are also so ancient that scholars
disagree on what modern symbols they should correspond to, and there are many
spots where the characters cannot be read.
“Fu Yi” (FY) – Fu Yi was a scholar who lived around 600 CE
and claimed that the version he presents and discusses was found in a grave
that from his description could possibly be dated to around 200 BCE.
“Wang Bi” (WB) – written around 240 CE, this is the
“standard” version that most translators use, although there are several
slightly different variations of it.
“He Shang Gong” (HSG) – a legendary and possibly mythical
person who may have lived around 170 BCE, but the work which presents and
discusses the version of the DDJ associated with him is not mentioned by others
until 300 CE.  Many scholars think this version was probably written
closer to 300 CE and attributed to He Shang Gong to give it authority. 
There are also many slightly different variations of this text available.
In comparing the six sources, it is easy to see the changes
in philosophy of the early Daoists over the centuries.  In general, the
three earliest versions (GUO, MWD/A, MWD/B) more-or-less agree with each other,
the three later versions (FY, WB, HSG) more-or-less agree with each other
(despite the tentative dating of FY to 200 BCE), the two groups are often
slightly different from each other, and occasionally very different. 
However, FY does sometimes agree with the three earlier versions.  Only
the later versions contain the vast majority of criticisms of Confucianism,
although even GUO has a few.
WB, HSG, and FY were chosen as sources for this translation
mainly because their earliest manuscripts are complete, and the Chinese
characters are “modern” enough that there is less doubt as to their
meaning.  But there are occasional differences between them, so a 2/3
majority vote was used to determine which symbol to use.  This would
result in a document which is essentially the same as WB, since WB and HSG are
almost always the same.  However, in comparing all
six
sources (or
fewer if the chapter is not in GUO, or the earlier symbols cannot be read), it
becomes obvious that sometimes significant changes were made only in the most
recent sources.  Thus a symbol was changed to the one used by the older
sources if the majority of
all
available sources use the different
symbol, and it adds to the understanding of the sentence.  In the case of
a tie, the more recent symbol was used.  These rules were used for adding
or deleting symbols as well.
==============================================================
The Translation
Process
There are many reasons why translations differ, besides the
problems inherent in translating from a language where : each symbol represents
a word that has multiple (sometimes very different) meanings; tenses, articles,
and plurals are not indicated; and one symbol can represent either a noun or
adjective, another a verb or adverb, another all four!
What source is used : for WB and HSG, which version of
     what source; in the oldest sources, what modern symbols to use
Accurately knowing all the possible English meanings for
     each symbol (and sometimes pairs of symbols), including changes in meaning
     over the millennia, and understanding ancient idioms
Having to pick just one meaning for each symbol
Organizing each sentence into something that makes sense,
     which is helped by understanding something of ancient Chinese grammar
The cultural background, knowledge, biases, beliefs, and
agenda of the translator affect every step but the first.  “Agenda” refers
to how the translator approaches the content of the DDJ : as a work of
mysticism vs. philosophy vs. military strategy vs. advice to emperors, etc.
The goals for this translation were :
Include an English word or
     phrase for every Chinese symbol in the sentence
Use exact translations of the
     Chinese symbols wherever possible
Minimal interpretation of
     individual symbols, only where needed for clarity
Use the same English word(s)
     for the same symbol(s) when appropriate
As few added English words as
     possible to make it a correct English sentence
No interpretation of the final
     translated sentence
Individual symbols are
interpreted only when they either don’t make as much sense literally, or the
resulting sentence would be awkward in English.  In some cases, if a
symbol means two English words that both seem to fit equally well, they are
combined into one phrase, such as “heart/mind” for
心
(see the
next section), or
玄
which can mean “mystery”, “profound”, “deep”, or “dark”, and is consistently translated
as “deep and mysterious” or “deep mystery”, depending on the context.
The above goals hopefully help minimize, but cannot
eliminate, translator bias.  The problem is that each Chinese symbol still
has several meanings, and the translator must pick just one for each symbol
(step 3) to create an English sentence that makes sense (step 4).  It is
impossible to avoid translator bias here because the translator must choose
what makes sense or feels right to them, in both word meanings and overall
grammar.
For example, there is a line in
chapter 58 :
禍
兮
福
之
所
倚
where
兮
can mean
“good fortune” or “happiness” and
禍
can mean “misfortune” or “disaster”, but by reflection with
兮
could also be interpreted as
“unhappiness”.
倚
can mean “lean on”, “rely on”, or “depend on”, so all of these are valid
translations :
Misfortune is that which good
fortune leans on.
Misfortune is that which good
fortune relies on.
Misfortune is that which good
fortune depends on.
Unhappiness is that which happiness
leans on.
Unhappiness is that which happiness
relies on.
Unhappiness is that which happiness
depends on.
Beyond the differences between using “fortune” (less
personal : what happens to you) versus “happiness” (more personal : how you
feel), there are also subtle differences : saying that one “relies” on the
other is different than saying that they mutually support each other (as
possibly indicated by the sentence following this one, not shown
here).
Unlike the previous example,
where the different translations for each symbol are more-or-less related,
sometimes the choice the translator makes can affect the overall meaning or
even the emotional impact of the sentence.  In chapter 20, there is a line
:
我
獨
若
遺
in which the last symbol can be variously
translated into :
I alone seem
lost.
I alone seem to have lost
everything.
I alone seem to have been left
behind.
I alone seem to be forgotten.
Each of which says a completely
different thing.
And in chapter 46, there is a
line :
罪
莫
大
於
可
欲
where the first symbol can mean any of : “sin”, “crime”, “vice”, or “fault”, so
(ignoring options for the other symbols), all of these are valid :
There is no sin greater than the
capacity for desire.
There is no crime greater than the
capacity for desire.
There is no vice greater than the
capacity for desire.
There is no fault greater than the
capacity for desire.
“Sin” of course has very negative religious connotations in
the West, while “crime” and “vice” also have stronger negative associations
than “fault”.
But there are other, even more
significant ways in which the translator’s choices affect the result. 
Because of the many (sometimes unrelated) possible meanings of each Chinese
symbol, it is possible to come up with multiple translations of the exact same
sentence that are completely different in meaning!  For example, in
chapter 41, there is a line :
大
方
無
隅
where
方
can mean both
“region” and “square”, while
隅
can be “border” or “corner”, so both of these are valid translations :
The greatest region is without
borders.
The greatest square is without
corners.
And in chapter 45 :
大
巧
若
拙
where
巧
can be “skillful” or “clever”, and
拙
can mean “stupid” or
“clumsy”, both of these are equally likely :
Great skillfulness seems clumsy.
Great cleverness seems stupid.
Finally, even when there is no
ambiguity about the meaning of the individual symbols, it sometimes hard to determine
what overall meaning was intended.  From chapter 35, there is a line :
道
之
出
言
淡
兮
in
which the first four symbols literally mean “words of Dao”, but does this mean
“talking about Dao” or “the words that come out of Dao”?  It can be argued
both ways due to subtleties in the meanings of the symbols, but there is a
tremendous difference in meaning between the two translations.
In addition, there are a few symbols whose modern English
meanings just don’t make sense within the context of the sentence, probably due
either to transcription errors or changes in meaning over the millennia. 
The English words used for these symbols are usually selected according to
context.
==============================================================
Common Terms
Because the translation itself is meant to involve minimal
interpretation and explanation, some of the words and phrases that are used
repeatedly need to be discussed beforehand for clarity.  Keep in mind that
volumes have been written about some of these concepts – these are just brief
summaries for the reader new to Daoism.
道
Dao : most often translated as the
“way”; according to various passages in the DDJ, Dao appears to be the way of
nature (or the universe), the process of being in harmony with that way, the
source that creates and nourishes all things, and absolute ultimate reality
itself (and according to the opening lines of the first chapter, this
description is completely inadequate); it is left untranslated so that readers
may “fill in the blank” for themselves as they read; “the Dao” is used as
little as possible because in English that implies that Dao is more of a thing
than a process; Dao is sometimes referred to as “it” to avoid awkward grammar
(or if it was written that way in the original Chinese), but do not think of
Dao as a noun (just for fun sometime, try reading “Dao” as “Daoing”…); one
exception is when “Dao of” is used (for example, “the Dao of heaven”) – this
seems to be literally referring to the way heaven does things, so it is translated
as “the Way of heaven”, but “Way” is capitalized to remind the reader that this
is also Dao; similarly, “this Dao” seems to be referring more to “this
way
(of following Dao), and is translated “this Way”
德
De : most
often translated as “virtue”, “integrity”, or “(inner) power”, De is described
in chapter 49 as “goodness” or “virtue” and “honesty” or “trust”; De might be
infused into things when they are created by/from Dao, or something that
develops when Dao is fully expressed through a person; De seems to be both the
quality of being virtuous and the power that comes from being virtuous, so it
might best be thought of as “the power of one’s virtue” or “the power from
one’s integrity”, but it is also left untranslated so that readers may “fill in
the blank” for themselves as they read
天
“heaven” : a complex concept, this
symbol seems to have connotations of the sky, nature (including people and
societies), that which controls our destinies, as well as possibly that of a
celestial god-like spirit (and/or perhaps ancestral spirits)
天
地
“heaven and earth” :
everything, the universe, all that is
天
下
“the
world” : literally “heaven under”, it is perhaps better thought of as “all
things under heaven”; it is left as “the world” because the English grammar
sometimes gets awkward using the more accurate phrase; some translate it as
“the empire”, which gives the entire document a much more imperialistic and
militaristic slant
萬
物
“ten thousand creatures” :
“ten thousand” as used here does not refer to a specific number, but means
“innumerable” or “myriad”; together the symbols are perhaps better thought of
as “all creatures and things”
聖
人
“sage” : literally “holy
man”; in the DDJ, a sage is anyone who fully embodies and expresses Dao and De;
as the ruling class would have been one of the few literate groups in ancient
Chinese culture reading the DDJ, it seems possible that references to the way
the sage does things could have also been a subtle way of saying “this is what
a wise
ruler
would do” (especially in chapters like 5, 57, and 66, where
the sage seems to be the ruler)
常
“ever-constant” : while this is
often translated as “eternal”, it probably had more of a sense of “constant” or
“permanent” in ancient China; unfortunately “constant” doesn’t imply the
enduring nature of “permanent”, nor does “permanent” imply the unchanging
quality of “constant”, so “ever-constant” is used here
心
“heart/mind” : usually translated as
either “heart” or “mind” (the symbol means both), “heart/mind” seems to be the
best translation
自
然
“naturally so” : this has
the connotation of something that happens spontaneously, without being forced
(“of itself”, “of its own accord”, “on its own”); Dao is “naturally so”, and although
the DDJ does not say so explicitly, presumably the sage acts “naturally so” as
well
樸
“uncarved block” (of wood) : just as
a block of wood can be carved into virtually anything, in the DDJ the “uncarved
block” represents the limitless undefined potential of our original nature
無
為
“non-action” : not
passivity or lack of action, but spontaneous action taken at the proper time
according to the situation
無
事
“non-interference”
: to change the natural order of things as little as possible in achieving your
goals
無
知
“without-knowledge”
: not an absence of knowledge, but a kind of understanding that does not resort
to pre-conceived ideas or rules
無
名
“without-name” : a
reminder that things, concepts, and experiences are far more than the names we give
them and ultimately cannot be described with words (in contrast to the
Confucians, whose goal was to find the “correct name” for everything)
無
欲
“without-desire” : not a
total lack of desire, but desires that do not control us or our happiness; a sort
of spontaneous, unattached desire
無
or
無
有
“non-being” : the
nameless absolute that is the source of all existence (“being”)
爭
“strive” : to struggle or make
vigorous effort to achieve something, perhaps competing against others to get
it; the opposite of non-action
陰
“yin” : the feminine principle;
receptive, yielding, dark, cool, soft
陽
“yang” : the masculine principle;
aggressive, active, light, warm, hard
氣
“qi” (ch’i,
chi) : vitality, life energy, life force, vital energy
善
“virtue” : the
traditional sense of moral virtue and  goodness
靜
“stillness” : a mental/emotional
stillness of the heart/mind
谷
“valley” : the image of the valley
is often used in the DDJ; a valley represents receptiveness (because it accepts
all things that come into it), openness, and emptiness, and so is feminine in
nature
身
“self” : often translated as “body”
by others (it can mean either), it is my personal bias that this symbol seems
to consistently refer to the sense-of-self, personality, or ego
復
or
歸
or
復
歸
or
反
“returning” : the DDJ uses four
different symbols to refer to the concept of returning, and it is used many
times; beyond the everyday meaning, in the DDJ creatures and people often
return to their source, true nature, or original state of pure and unformed
potential; sometimes they just “return”, and from where or to where is not
specified
明
“insight” : an intuitive,
without-knowledge, understanding of what is; this is another personal bias –
while the literal translations include “wise”, “clear”, “understanding”,
“perceptive”, and “sight”, it seems that this symbol can be consistently
interpreted as “insight” (which is in agreement with the literal translations);
in addition, it is variously translated by other modern translators as “enlightenment”
and even “insight”
事
“duties” :
one’s personal and business affairs, responsibilities, etc.
吾
“I” : on the
rare occasions this is used, think of this as someone who is a sage-like Daoist
rather than merely “the author”
百
姓
“100
families” : in ancient times this phrase referred to the entire ruling class
士
“scholar” : around the time of the
DDJ, this referred to the elite “intellectual” class of  Chinese society,
the teachers and philosophers (Confucius would have been considered a scholar)
君
“ruler”,
王
“king”, etc. : there are many
symbols and euphemisms for various members of the nobility (“nobles”,
“superiors”, “master of the people”, “son of heaven”, “master of 10,000
chariots”, etc.)
貴
“high rank” : any position of power
or admiration
While the DDJ is over 2000 years old, its wisdom is still
applicable today, but don’t be fooled by the ancient wording!  
“King” could today apply to anyone who runs things, manages others, or leads
any kind of group (from the nation’s leader to a corporation CEO to…your boss),
and “high rank” could apply to government officials, billionaires, or even
movie stars.
There are also many Confucian terms used in the DDJ :
仁
“kindness” : being benevolent,
kindhearted, humane
義
“righteousness”
(translated as “morality” to avoid religious associations) : having a sense of
justice, doing
the right thing, being morally
upright
禮
“propriety” : ritual courtesy and
formality; proper etiquette
智
“wise”, “wisdom” :
as it says
信
“truth”, “trust”,
“honest” : as it says
忠
“loyalty” : as it
says
勇
“courage”, “brave”
: as it says
廉
“honorable” : having a sense of
honor or integrity; incorruptibility
孝
“filial piety” (translated as
“devoted children”) : respect your elders and parents, duty to your parents,
care
for the
elderly
慈
“compassion” :
benevolence, mercy; as specifically applied to parents’ attitude towards their
children, this is
translated as “loving parents”
君
子
“noble man” : literally
“son of the ruler”, this can mean “nobleman” (one who belongs to the nobility),
but is also a Confucian term that
means one who is noble or moral in character and embodies the above
qualities; sometimes translated by
others as “gentleman” or “superior man”
Many symbols in the DDJ are used to provide emphasis
(similar to an exclamation point in English), and can either come at the end of
a sentence or can be used to emphasize a word or phrase in the middle of a
sentence.  Many translators ignore these latter symbols entirely, while
others preface the emphasized word with “so…”, “such…”, “very…”, “oh,…”,
etc.  Here, an exclamation point is used immediately after the word, but
then the sentence continues on.  One symbol in particular implies that what
precedes it is not only true but has always been true, which is translated as
“indeed!”

The Dao that can be spoken
  of is not the ever-constant Dao.
The name that can be named is
  not the ever-constant name.
That which is without-name
  is the beginning of heaven and
earth.
That which possesses a name
  is the mother of the ten
thousand creatures.
Therefore : always
  without-desire, thus you observe its
subtle mystery.
Always possessing desires,
  thus you observe its external
appearances.
These two, they arise from
  the same source but have
different names;
This sameness is called
  their deep mystery.
Deep mysteries, and again
  deep mysteries –
The gateway of many subtle
  mysteries.

In the world, when all know
  that the action of beauty is
beautiful, then ugliness ensues.
When all know that the
  action of good is goodness, then
not-good ensues.
Therefore : being and
  non-being create each other,
Difficult and easy complete
  each other,
Long and short contrast
  each other,
High and low lean on each
  other,
Tone and voice harmonize
  each other,
Before and after follow
  each other.
Thus the sage :
Lives by using non-action
  in his duties,
And practicing no-talking
  in his teachings.
The ten thousand creatures
  arise, but do not have a
beginning.
Creating but not
  possessing;
Acting, but not concerned
  with the results;
Accomplishing tasks, but
  not dwelling on them.
Now : only because there is
  no dwelling,
Thus the results do not
  depart.

Heaven is eternal, earth is

The reason that heaven and

Is because they do not live

Therefore they can live

Puts his self behind

Considers his self

Water’s virtue benefits the

It dwells in places that
  everyone detests,
Therefore it is almost

In dwelling, the virtue is

In your heart/mind, the

A :
presumably, a cup;
  Lau says that this refers to a vessel in a temple that stood upright when
  empty but overturned when nearly full (thus you had to hold it to fill it up)
B :
presumably, a sword
  or knife; you can only re-shape and re-sharpen it so many times

Favor and disgrace seem
  alarming.
High rank brings great
  suffering if you have a self.
What is meant by “favor and
  disgrace seem alarming”?
Favor makes you the
  inferior, so gaining it seems alarming.
Losing it also seems
  alarming.
This is what is meant by
  “favor and disgrace seem
alarming”.
What is meant by “high rank
  brings great suffering if you

I am the reason that I have

Therefore : he who is high

Notes
A :
Ames&Hall point
  out that “favor” here means something that is bestowed upon you by a superior
  at their whim, thus it emphasizes your inferiority to them; and since it
  could be taken away just as easily, merely gaining it is cause for “alarm”
  (worry, anxiety, etc.)
B : this is written in this
  awkward manner to emphasize that it is the personality or sense-of-self that
  is being talked about (in the translator’s opinion – see the Introduction and
  cross-references below)

The virtue of the ancients
  made they who were scholars
subtle, mysterious, obscure, deep, and penetrating.
Their mysterious depths can
  not be understood.
Now : only because they can
  not be understood,
Therefore we try to emulate
  their appearance :
Hesitant!, as if crossing a
  winter stream.
Wary!, as if afraid of
  their neighbors all around.
Respectful!, they are like
  a visiting guest.
Yielding!, like ice that is
  about to to break off.
Honest and genuine!, they
  are like the uncarved block.
Wide and open!, they are
  like a valley.
Unclear!, they are like
  muddy water.
Who can take muddy water
  and use stillness to slowly and
gently make it pure and clear?
Who can take what is
  tranquil and use continual movement
to slowly and gently bring it to life?
He who maintains this Way
  does not desire to be full.
Now : only because he is
  not full,
Thus he can be hidden and

The

in this sentence and

  thus referring to churned-up thoughts and feelings
B :
apparently referring

Attain the utmost

Maintain a profound

The ten thousand creatures
  arise in unison,
And thus I observe their
  return.
Now : all the myriad
  creatures return to their source.
Returning to the source
  speaks of stillness.
Stillness is called
  returning to the natural order.
Returning to the natural
  order speaks of the ever-constant.
Knowing the ever-constant
  speaks of insight.
Not knowing the
  ever-constant is foolish and creates
misfortune.
Knowing the ever-constant
  leads to tolerance.
Being tolerant leads to
  being just and unbiased.
Being just and unbiased
  leads to being kingly.
Being kingly leads to
  heaven.
Heaven leads to Dao.
Dao leads to what endures.
When the self disappears,

Notes
A
  :
太
上
literally means “highest superior”, which is also a
  euphemism for the emperor (and so is extrapolated to rulers in general)
B :
in other words, he
  does not offer them lightly or often
; this line is very difficult to
  translate, because WB uses a unique first symbol, while HSG&FY and
  GUO&MWD/B each use different symbols; however, the two earlier symbols
  can both mean “to scheme”, thus making a 4/5 majority in meaning; the rest of
  the sentence is so terse that it can be translated in numerous ways as well
C :
under the proper
  rulership, everyone thinks everything just naturally works out right

Notes
By looking at all the
  sources, it is easy to see that this chapter grew more anti-Confucian over
  time!
A : the MWD texts use
  “knowledge” (a non-Confucian term) instead of “wisdom”; this whole sentence
  is absent in GUO
B : this symbol could also
  be interpreted as hypocrisy, pretense, lying, dishonesty, etc.
C : the six relationships
  refer to “all” the possible kinds of relationship in a family (in ancient
  China) : husband to wife, wife to husband, father to son, son to father,
  older brother to younger brother, younger brother to older brother

Notes
GUO is significantly
  different about what to renounce or abandon, and the results, and it uses
no
Confucian terms; as early as MWD/B and MWD/A some Confucian terms had
  appeared
A :
perhaps meaning a
  place
worth
belonging to?

Notes
This chapter seems to be
  the sage-like author poking fun at himself, describing how he
appears
to ordinary people who don’t understand him
; the “very’s” scattered throughout the chapter are implied by
  repeated symbols; only the first 6 lines are present in GUO
A : many people over the
  centuries have suggested that this line should be the last in #19 for many
  good reasons; however, there is an explicit end-of-chapter marker in GUO at
  the end of #19 (which is not even followed by #20 in its  manuscript),
  so this line does indeed seem to belong here
B : formal versus informal,
  respectively
C :
according to Lau,
  the Tai Lao sacrifice was a major feast where sheep, pigs, and ox were
  ritually sacrificed and eaten
D : in ancient China,
  terraces were man-made hills with paths cut into in their sides, leading up
  to a plateau at the top from which to view the surrounding landscape
E : only WB changed “seem”
  to “confused”, thus making “very confused”, keeping with all the other
  “very’s”
F : “drift” comes from HSG
  and FY (while they use different symbols, they have the same meaning, thus
  making a majority); the symbol in WB means “wind”, and so is incorporated
  into the added phrase; the “I” is added at the beginning to maintain the
  I/they alternation

A : compare to #14, where

  #40, where Dao specifically “returns” and “weakens”
B :
“this” could be

What is wrong then becomes

What is bent then becomes

What is hollow then becomes

What is worn out then
  becomes new.
Have little, then gain.
Have too much, then become

Thus the sage :
Embraces the One, thus

He does not display
  himself, therefore he has insight.
Does not consider himself
  correct, therefore he
distinguishes himself.
Does not boast about
  himself, therefore he possesses
merit.
Does not brag about
  himself, therefore he endures.
Now : only because he does
  not strive,
Therefore no one in the
  world can strive against him.
That which the ancients say
  :
“He who is wrong then
  becomes whole and perfect” –
How can these be empty
  words?
Be truly whole and perfect,
  and return to it.

the
ancients
[

say
:
“
He who
is
wrong
{
bent
}
then
becomes
whole and perfect
” –
How can

Be
truly
whole

and
return

Notes
A : there is no indication
  what the “it” is referring to in the original Chinese, so you decide! 
  This symbol also means “them”,
perhaps meaning “return to the ancients”?

Therefore : strong winds do
  not last the entire
  morning,
Sudden rains do not last
  the entire day.
Who makes these
  things?  Heaven and earth.
Even heaven and earth can
  not maintain them forever,
And so how much less can
  people?
Therefore : of those who
  engage in Dao –
He who Daos is one with
  Dao.
He who Des is one with

He who loses is one with

For he who is one with

Something existed unformed yet

Before heaven and earth were created.
Silent!  Empty!
Standing alone, not

It circulates everywhere, and causes no danger.
It can be considered the
  mother of the world.
I do not know its name;
Its symbol is called Dao.
If I tried to make its name, I would call it great.
Being great speaks of departing.
Departing speaks of being remote.

And the king resides as one of them!

Serious
  serves as the source of frivolous.
Stillness serves as the ruler of restlessness.
Thus the noble man travels
  the entire day,
And does not stray from his
  wagon.
He is serious, even though
  glorious sights and feasts exist;
He
  lives above them, like this.
So how could one be the
  master of ten thousand chariots,
And conduct his self
  frivolously in the world?
Be frivolous, then lose the
  source.
Be restless, then lose the rulership.

Notes
A : this symbol also means
  impatience, agitation, anxiety, etc;
“stillness” and “restlessness” are
  presumably referring to inner, mental/emotional qualities
B : Only WB and HSG changed
  “noble man” to the non-Confucian term “sage”
C : traditionally, the
  first symbol of this sentence is considered to be the last symbol of the
  previous sentence (“
heavy
wagon
”); but because the MWD’s have
  “fields” instead of “wagon” at the end of the previous sentence, and “heavy
  fields” makes no sense, it is parsed this way
D :
presumably, by being
  serious and still
E :
someone very important,
  such as the supreme ruler of a large nation (one with 10,000 chariots)
F : this is written in this
  awkward manner to emphasize that it is the personality or sense-of-self that
  is being talked about (in the translator’s opinion – see the Introduction and
  cross-references below)

A good traveler is without

A good accountant does not
  use counting tokens.
A good barrier is without
  bar or lock, yet can not be
opened.
A good binding is without

Thus the sage :
Is always good at helping people,
Therefore he does not

Is always good at helping
  creatures,
Therefore he does not
  abandon creatures.
This is called following

Therefore : he who is a

who is not a virtuous person.
He who is not a virtuous
  person is the resource of he who

If the latter does not

Or the former does not love

Even if there is wisdom, there

Would you take hold of the
  world and control
  it?
I see you have no choice.
Now : the world is a divine
  vessel,
You can not control it
  (indeed!).
He who acts, ruins it;
He who grasps, loses it.
Therefore : creatures are
Sometimes active, sometimes
  passive,
Sometimes breathe heavy,
  sometimes breathe easy,
Sometimes strong, sometimes
  weak,
Sometimes oppressed,
  sometimes overthrown.
Thus the sage :
Removes the extremes,
Removes the extravagant and
  wasteful,
Removes the arrogance.

Notes
A :
every
source
  uses a different symbol here!
B : it is hard to figure
  out what this sentence is trying to say (literally, “sometimes snort,
  sometimes blow” in WB);  and there is no concensus from the other
  sources, as they use
“exhale … blow”, “flatter …
  brag”, “breathe silently … breathe loudly”
C : other than WB and HSG,
  every source has a different pair in this line!

Now : fine weapons, they
  are not tools of good fortune.
Creatures detest them, no
  matter what.
Therefore : he who
  possesses Dao does not live by them.
When a noble man is in his
  dwelling, then he honors the
left.
When he commands troops,
  then he honors the right.
Weapons, they are not tools
  of good fortune.
They are not the tools of a
  noble man.
When he has no choice but
  to use them,
To be calm and indifferent
  is superior –
Never pleased, indeed!
And he who is pleased
  enjoys killing people.
Now : he who enjoys killing
  people
Can not get what he desires
  from the world!
Therefore : in fortunate
  affairs honor the left,
In unfortunate affairs honor
  the right.
Thus the assistant general
  of the army resides on the left,
The supreme general of the
  army resides on the right.
Thus we say they are
  dwelling at a funeral :
When many people are
  killed,
Then mourn and weep with
  grief for them.
Victory in war thus means
  they will dwell at a funeral.

Notes
The first three lines are
  not in GUO
A : WB and HSG’s use of
  “indifferent” seems the most neutral, but the three earliest sources
  technically have the majority with “reverent”, while FY has “peaceful”
B
  : this line comes from the MWD’s and GUO; the later sources are very
  different (and do not agree with each other); regardless of the source, this
  line and the next can be translated many different ways due to the multiple
  meanings of
美
(“pleased”, “beautiful”, “good”), and whether or
  not one assumes that weapons are still being talked about
C :
Ames and Hall point
  out that ancient Chinese custom puts the place of honor on the left in happy
  events, and on the right in sorrowful events; thus in war, the supreme
  general sits on the right, acknowledging that war is a sorrowful event, just
  like a funeral

Dao is ever-constantly
  without-name.
Even though the concept of the
  uncarved block seems
insignificant,
No one in the world can
  conquer it.
If nobles and kings could
  maintain it,
The ten thousand creatures
  would naturally obey.
Heaven and earth would join
  with each other,
Thus dropping a sweet dew.
There are no citizens who
  would make this happen,
Yet it would be naturally
  fair and impartial.
And so, begin to divide and
  you have names.
Once names exist,
Men should also be ready to
  know when to stop.
Knowing when to stop is the
  reason that there is no danger.

Notes
A :
possibly meaning
  one’s center, source or root (but then why not use one of the many symbols
  used elsewhere for these words?), this may be referring to one’s station or
  position in life (ancient Chinese society was highly stratified); but on the
  other hand, that sounds very Confucian – so you decide!
B : this line has generated
  much speculation over the millennia;
perhaps it refers to being remembered
  after you die, or the death of the “self”?

Great Dao is like a vast
  flood!
It is able to flow left and
  right.
The ten thousand creatures
  depend on it in order for life,
And are not rejected.
It accomplishes its tasks
  successfully,
Yet does not possess a
  name.
It clothes and supports the
  ten thousand creatures,
But does not act as their
  master.
Therefore : since it is
  ever-constantly without-desire,
It can then be named
  insignificant.
Since the ten thousand
  creatures return to it
But it does not act as
  their master,
It can then be named great.
Thus the sage can achieve
  greatness
Because he does not act
  great.
Therefore he can achieve

Holding fast to the great
  image,
The entire world comes
  towards you.
Comes towards you, and meeting
  with no harm,
There is the greatest peace

Music together with good
  food make passing guests stay,
But Dao’s words are bland!
They are without flavor.

Notes
A : “doing” could just as
  easily be used here, but since the sage is the one who does no harm in #58,
  #60, and #66, “meeting with” is used
B : the sentence-as-a-whole
  can be interpreted in two different ways (see the Introduction) : “speaking
  about Dao” or “the words that come out of Dao” (which is used here); also
  note that in the majority of the sources this line is a statement, not a
  question

Notes
This chapter is
  anti-Confucian as early as MWD/B!
A :
he does not lose De
  in that he is always trying to show that he has De
B : “coerces” is the same
  symbol as “acts”, but is used here to emphasize that it is the opposite of
  “non-action”
C : this line varies
  greatly between all the sources, and there is no majority; this comes from FY
  as it seems to make the most sense
D : this could also mean “
future
knowledge
” and so is often translated as “foreknowledge”,
  “prescience”, etc.
E :
fruit provides
  nourishment, whereas a flower is merely showy
F : compare to #50 and #75,
  where living for the “substance” is apparently a bad thing
G :
presumably,
  appearance and the “flower” vs. substance and the “fruit” (respectively)

Of those who in ancient
  times attained oneness :
Heaven attained oneness,
  thus becoming pure and clear.
Earth attained oneness,
  thus becoming stable.
Spirit attained oneness,
  thus becoming potent.
The valley attained
  oneness, thus becoming full.
The ten thousand creatures
  attained oneness, thus
becoming alive.
Nobles and kings attained
  oneness, thus serving the world
faithfully.
They attained it.
If heaven could not use its
  purity and clarity,
I fear it would split
  apart.
If earth could not use its
  stability,
I fear it would erupt.
If spirit could not use its
  potency,
I fear it would cease to
  be.
If the valley could not use
  its fullness,
I fear it would be used up.
If the ten thousand
  creatures could not use their life,
I fear they would be
  destroyed.
If nobles and kings could
  not use their high rank and
prominence,
I fear they would fall.
Therefore : humility thus
  serves as the source of high rank;
Low thus serves as the
  foundation of high.
Thus nobles and kings call
  themselves orphaned, lonely,
and unlucky.
Does this not mean that
  humility thus serves as the source?
Does it not?
Therefore : to attain
  exceptional popularity is to be without
popularity –
Do not desire to be scarce
  like jade,
But common like rock.

Notes
A :
all creatures grow weaker
  as they age, and all man-made things decay and fall apart, which is the way
  (Dao) of the universe; this is why in #30 and #55 creatures which are old but
  still robust are “not Dao”
; compare these first two lines to #14 and #21,
  where Dao’s action is indistinct and confusing
B : technically, the
  majority of the sources read “The
creatures
of
the
world
…”
  but “ten thousand creatures” is such a standard saying everywhere else that
  it is retained here from the other sources
C : compare to #42, where

The superior scholar
  hearing of Dao works hard and
practices it.
The average scholar hearing
  of Dao seems to keep it,
seems to lose it.
The inferior scholar
  hearing of Dao laughs greatly at it.
If he did not laugh, it
  would not be qualified to be Dao.
Therefore : in the
  established sayings that exist, it is said –
Insight into Dao seems like
  darkness.
Advancing in Dao seems like
  retreating.
Smooth Dao seems knotted.
Superior De seems like a

Notes
A : Ames&Hall comment
  that it is unknown whether “established sayings” is referring to proverbs in
  general, or a specific work that no longer exists
B : compare to #53, where
  “Dao is extremely even”
C : this line could just as
  likely be translated as
The
greatest
square
is
without
corners
but considering that the
  DDJ often refers to nations, this translation seems more appropriate
D : a euphemism for “great
  talents mature slowly”
E : although this line only
  survives in MWD/B of the three earlier sources, it is used here because it is
  much more straightforward and understandable than the later three

Dao creates one.
One creates two.
Two creates three.
Three creates the ten
  thousand creatures.
The ten thousand creatures
  carry Yin and embrace Yang,
Pouring their Qi together,
  thus becoming harmonious.
That which people detest :
Being alone, orphaned,
  lonely, and unlucky –
Yet kings and nobles thus
  name themselves.
Therefore : creatures
Sometimes lose, yet they
  gain;
Sometimes gain, yet they
  lose.
That which people teach, I
  also teach :
Those who are bullies and
  hoodlums do not meet their
natural death.
I will thus become their

  consistent with #27, where a virtuous person is the teacher of a non-virtuous

Notes
A : this line is in every
  source except WB
B
  : The core of this sentence is “
足
of
足
always
足
”, where
足
can mean “enough”, “sufficient”, or possibly
  “satisfaction” (and by interpretation, “contentment”), so it can be
  translated in many ways; while I usually use the same English word for each
  symbol (when appropriate), in this case it seems clearer to use different
  words with equivalent meanings within the same sentence; this would be similar
  to changing the phrase “appears to have appeared” to “seems to have appeared”

Notes
A : compare to #50, which
  refers to one who “takes in life”; “gathering” is used for consistency with
  #36; the repeated symbol implies “very”, hence completeness
B
  : this line can be translated in many ways, mainly due to the fact that the
  symbol for “merges” can also mean “muddled” or “whole”; also
其
(
his
/
their
) could be referring to the
  sage or to the 100 families; the choices made here are consistent with the
  first two lines of the chapter
C : compare to #12, where
  the sage does not act on what he sees
D : adding “his” turns this
  line from something deragatory (“treats them all like children”, which seems
  out of character) into something that matches #42, where the sage becomes an
  “elder teacher” (literally, godfather)

Between coming out into
  life and entering death,
Followers of life are 3 in
  10.
Followers of death are 3 in
  10.
People whose lives are merely
  moving them towards the
place of death
Are also 3 in 10.
Now : what is the reason?
Because they live life for
  its substance.
But I have heard that he
  who is skilled at taking in life
Can travel the mountains
  and does not meet rhino or tiger,
Can enter a battle not
  wearing armor or weapons.
The rhino has no place to
  thrust its horns,
The tiger has no place to
  use its claws,
The weapon has no place to
  allow its blade.
Now : what is the reason?
Because for him there is no
  place of death.

Notes
A : “follower” as in disciple
  or one who agrees with a particular way of looking at things
B : this phrase can also be
  interpreted as “13”, possibly referring to the 4 limbs and 9 openings of the
  human body, but when using “3 in 10” then the first five lines discuss 9 out
  of 10 people, and the remaining lines seem to talk about the tenth (
presumably
  sage-like
) person
C : there are many
  different interpretations of this phrase (and the entire sentence);
presumably,
  the “place of death” is the end destination of the journey of life as opposed
  to a literal location (a more modern interpretation of the symbols is the
  “point of death”)
; while the symbols for this sentence come from WB and
  HSG and are technically a minority, the phrasing they use here matches that
  in the third line following
D : compare to #38, where
  living for the “substance” is apparently a good thing, and #75, where it is a
  bad thing
E : compare to #49, where
  the sage “gathers in the world”; the last part of this sentence could also be
  translated as “
he who
has
virtue
and
takes in
life
”

Dao creates them,

Things shape them,
Circumstances complete
  them.
Thus among the ten thousand

There are none who do not respect
  Dao and honor De.
Respect of Dao,
Honor of De –
Now : there is no one who
  commands this,
Yet it is always naturally

Therefore : Dao creates

Leads them, nourishes them,
Shelters them, heals

Supports them, protects

Creating but not

C : while the common meaning
  of this symbol is “observe” (as used elsewhere), here it is taken to mean to
  contemplate or meditate upon, with the connotation of examining a concept in

D :
“this” could be

  in front of you, or to the teachings of the DDJ, or to something else – you

Wasps, scorpions, snakes,

Fierce beasts do not seize

Birds of prey do not claw
  him.
His bones are weak, his

He has the utmost essence,

He cries the entire day yet

Use honesty and justness
  when governing a nation.
Use strange and unusual
  tactics when commanding troops.
Use non-interference to
  take hold of the world.
How do I thus know it is
  like this?
By means of this :
The world has many
  prohibitions and taboos,
And the citizens become
  even poorer.
The citizens have many
  sharp tools,
And the nation and the

The people have too much

And strange things begin to

Matters of law are

I cherish stillness, and

Notes
The very’s in the first four

A : every source has a
  different symbol here; this comes from WB
B : this line and the next
  can be translated many ways because of the numerous meanings of their last
  symbols (see the Introduction) – the translation given here is the most
  “neutral”, saying only that they depend on each other
C : literally “
their
extremes
”,
presumably in the sense of “to what extremes they will
  go” or “how far will they go”
; compare to #59
D : this symbol also has
  the sense of “morally upright”, “principled”, and “ethical”
E : compare to #28 where
  the “greatest cutting does not divide” (also in relation to the sage)
F : every source has a
  different symbol, but three of them mean “to shine, dazzle, be glorious” thus
  making a majority in meaning; compare to how the sage does not “display” in
  #22, #47, #72, #77

Now : only when you can be

Early acceptance is called

Governing a great nation is

Its ghosts do not have

Not that its ghosts do not

The sage also does not

Notes
A : compare this line to
  the first two lines of the previous chapter and it is easy to see why there
  has long been speculation that this line should end the previous chapter;
  however, there is an explicit end-of-chapter marker in GUO #59, and GUO does
  not even contain this chapter;
essentially this line is saying it is easy
  to ruin a small fish by overcooking, and it is easy to ruin a nation by
  over-controlling
B : first – the “it” is
  literal,
presumably meaning “the world’s ghosts”
; second – “ghosts” is
  the most literal, general term, but this could also be referring to demons
  (or possibly to souls of the ancestors); third – “spirit” might be better
  thought of in this chapter as “spiritual power”,
thus this line seems to
  be saying that ghosts do not have any power in the world
; this and the
  next few lines can be translated in many different ways, due to the multiple
  meanings of the symbols for “ghost” and “spirit”, and the lack of any
  reasonable context –
perhaps these lines were addressing some lost ancient
  scholarly debate or common cultural belief?

A great nation is like the
  lowest places water can flow –
The merging place of the
  world,
The female of the world.
The female always uses
  stillness to conquer the male.
By using stillness, she
  becomes lower-than.
Therefore : if a great
  nation is lower-than a small nation,
Then it takes hold of the
  small nation.
If a small nation is
  lower-than a great nation,
Then it is taken hold of by
  the great nation.
Therefore : sometimes one
  nation is lower-than in order
to take hold of,
Sometimes one nation is
  lower-than and then it is taken
hold of.
A great nation merely
  desires to combine livestock and
people,
A small nation merely
  desires to get work for its people.
Now : for both nations to
  each get that which is their desire,
It is proper for the great
  nation to be lower-than.

B : literally “below”,

That which Daos is the

This is the treasure of a

And that which is the
  protection of a person who is not
virtuous.
Beautiful speech can be used

Respectful behavior can

People who are not
  virtuous,
Why abandon them?
Therefore : when
  inaugurating the son of heaven,
Or installing the three
  nobles –
Even if you possessed jade
  disks drawn by a team of four
horses,
That is not as good as
  sitting and offering this Way.
What was the ancients’
  reason that they valued this Way?
Did they not say :
Seek in order to obtain,
Have faults in order to be
  forgiven?
Therefore Dao becomes

Notes
A : although they are in
  the minority, I rather like what the MWD’s say :
That
  which
Daos
is the
flowing together
of
the
ten thousand
creatures
B :
presumably, for
  bartering
C : these two symbols could
  just as likely be translated as “
honorable
deeds
”
D: the “son of heaven” is a
  standard phrase referring to the emperor
E : specifically Dukes (see
  #32), but in keeping with other chapters, this is interpreted more generally
  as “nobles”; the phrase “three Dukes” specifically refers to the highest
  state officials, advisors, or ministers
F : a very expensive and
  impressive offering, indeed!
G : there is no subject in
  the original Chinese; Dao is assumed based on the 4
th
line
  previous

Notes
Only the first four
  sentences and the last three are in GUO.
A : this line could also be
  translated as
Taste
without
tasting
or
Taste
by
non
-
tasting
but it is phrased this way
  because of the reference in #35 about how Dao’s words are “without flavor”
  (using the same two symbols in both chapters)
B : this line literally
  reads “
too many
easy
certainly
too many
difficult
” but is worded in this way due to
  the lines that precede and follow it

Citizens are always on the

The virtue of the ancients
  (they who acted in Dao),
Did not use it to enlighten
  the citizens,
But would have used it to
  keep them ignorant –
The citizens are hard to
  govern
Because they have too much
  knowledge.
Therefore : using knowledge
  to govern the nation
Is the bane of the nation.
Not using knowledge to
  govern the nation
Is the good fortune of the
  nation.
He who has knowledge of
  these two also has them as
examples.
To always understand these
  examples –
This is called deep and

Deep and mysterious De is
  so profound! and remote!
That when creatures return,
  it returns with them!
Then they reach the

The reason that rivers and
  seas can act as kings of the 100
valleys
Is because they are good at
  being lower-than them.
Therefore : they can act as
  kings of the 100 valleys.
Thus the sage :
In desiring to be above the
  citizens,
He must by means of his
  speech be lower-than them.
In desiring to be before
  the citizens,
He must by means of his
  self be behind them.
Thus the sage :
Lives above them, but the
  citizens are not burdened.
Lives in front of them, but
  the citizens are not harmed.
Thus the world is pleased
  to promote him, and does not
tire of him.
Because he does not strive,
Therefore no one in the

In the world, all say I am

But do not seem to be like everyone

Now : only because I am not

can be great.
If I was like everyone

Long ago! I would have

Now : I possess three
  treasures –
Hold and maintain them.
The first is called
  compassion,
The second is called
  economy,
The third is called not
  daring to act first in the world.
With compassion, you can
  therefore be brave.
With economy, you can
  therefore expand.
By not daring to act first
  in the world,
Therefore you can achieve
  the capacity for leadership.
At present, people abandon
  compassion but also try to be
brave,
Abandon economy but also
  try to expand,
Abandon being behind but
  also try to be first –
This is death!
Now : when compassion is used
  in war, the consequence
is victory.
When it is used for
  protection, the consequence is strength.
When heaven would help you,
Using compassion it
  protects you.

Notes
A : this may sound
  egotistical, but the sage is described as being “great” in #34 and #63 and
  “valued” in #70; only WB and HSG changed this and the next four lines to read
In the
world
2
,
all
say
my
Dao
is
great
,
And does
not
seem
to
be like
[anything else].
Now
:
only
[because it is]
great
,
therefore
it
  does
not
seem
to
be like
[anything else].
If
[it was]
like
[anything else],
Long ago
!
it
would have become
insignificant
,
indeed!
WB also switched from
  saying the sage is great to Dao is great in #34; also note that here it is
  everyone else, not the sage, who says the sage is great
B
  : see #20 for many examples of how the sage is not like everyone else; this
  and the next three lines are translated in many different ways because
肖
(“seem”, “resemble”) sounds the same as a different
  symbol meaning “small” and so is sometimes interpreted that way, and because
不
肖
can also mean “unworthy”
C
  : this sentence comes from MWD/B for consistency with the previous lines
D :
presumably take the
  lead, rule, etc.
; compare to #7 and #66 about being behind to be first
E :
this could be
  referring to expanding your territory or kingdom

A : literally “below”,

  lower or inferior position in a relationship (which in ancient Chinese
  culture was the better thing to do); Lau translates it as “taking the lower
  position”
B : This could also be
  translated as

Notes
There are two themes in
  this chapter which do not seem to fit in with typical Daoist concepts – that
  of heaven
conquering
(literally “victory” or “beat”, interpreted as
  “achieving its goals”) which sounds more like striving than non-action, and
planning
(interpreted as “prepares”) which seems contradictory to being “naturally so”
  (although the sage also “plans” here and in #63)
A :
in early societies,
  whatever endeavors failed were by definition what heaven (or the gods)
  “detested”
B : this sentence only
  appears in the later sources, and seems to be a parenthetical comment;
  although it technically is in the majority, it seems so out-of-place that it
  is left out of the final translation above
C : this sentence is nearly
  impossible to translate; while the first symbol in WB and HSG are the same,
  making them the default “majority”, it is different in every other source,
  and
none
of their modern translations make sense; some translators use
  a symbol slightly different than that in WB and HSG but pronounced the same
  way; finally, “slow, patient, calm” is only the most likely translation that
  could be found for the first symbol
D : “extremely” is implied
  by the repeated symbol

  play on words
B : literally, they “

C : HSG and FY have
Because
their
superiors
seek
the
substance
of
life
thus placing the blame not
  on the people, but those who govern them (WB used the viewpoint of the
  earlier sources)
D : compare to #38, where
  living for the “substance” is apparently a good thing, and #50, where it is a
  bad thing
E :
one who “values
  living” will be less virtuous than one who does not, because the former is
  out to get what he can for himself

The people are born
  (indeed!) soft and weak.
They die (indeed!) hard and
  inflexible.
The ten thousand creatures,
  the grass and trees, are born
(indeed!) soft and fragile.
They die (indeed!) dried
  and withered.
Therefore : that which is
  hard and inflexible is a follower
of death.
That which is soft and weak
  is a follower of life.
Thus if a weapon is
  inflexible, the consequence is defeat.
If a tree is inflexible,
  then it snaps.
Inflexible and great dwell
  below.
Soft and weak dwell above.

Notes
The point of the
  beginning of this chapter seems to be that the sage does not create
  resentments in the first place
A :
Lau says that the
  left side of a contract or agreement was the creditor’s side, so the sage is
  the one who is owed
B :
Hatcher points out
  that while the Way of heaven itself is without favor, virtuous people have
  aligned themselves with it (because of their virtue), hence it is “with” them

Notes
A : the symbol literally
  refers only to tools, but has been associated with weapons in #31, #36, and
  #57 : “sharp tools”, “weapons are not the tools of a noble man”
B : the symbol specifically
  refers to a Count (see #32), but in keeping with other chapters, this is
  interpreted more generally as “nobles”;
the entire phrase probably means
  “as many weapons as the armies of ten Counts would have”
C :
have no need to use
  them; in other words, they do not want to leave, as supported by the last
  paragraph
D : compare to #36, where
  the sharp tools of the nation cannot be shown to the people
E :
according to
  Ames&Hall, knotted ropes used to be used for record-keeping

Appendix –
Different Layers of the Dao De Jing
While translating the DDJ, I discovered John Emerson’s articles
on the possibility of various “layers” within it, based on the presence or
absence of certain symbols and “themes” in each chapter.  While he was not
the first to suggest the presence of multiple layers, of particular interest to
me was his comment : “Many of the objections to my method seemed to be
objections to the kinds of rough, empirical, non-algorithmic methods best used
to disentangle historically confused material.”  Having a background in
something called pattern recognition, I decided to find out whether or not each
chapter could be classified as belonging to these layers based on this purely
analytical method.
Emerson tentatively identified Early, Middle, Late, Added
(very small) and Post-Guodian layers.  By definition, the Post-Guodian
layer contains at least chapters 67-81, none of which appear in the Guodian
source.  Building on Emerson’s work, extensive analysis using pattern
recognition methods based on the relative frequencies of the symbols in each
chapter indicates that the most self-consistent results are obtained when the
DDJ is separated into three layers of chapters :
Early :
1
4
5

7

13

Mixed :
2
Excluding the chapters he identified as Middle (which ended
up being assigned very evenly across the other three layers), none of these
completely disagree with Emerson’s assignments (except for 52, which is the
only entire chapter he considered to be Added), although he assigns some
sections of some chapters to other layers.  While a significant majority
(85%) of the chapters were
strongly
identified as belonging to their
layer (the underlined chapters above), the pattern recognition process did
indicate that a few (most notably chapters 24, 45, 46, 59, and 62, and to a
lesser extent 8, 22, 30, 39, 44, and 49) may have elements of more than one
layer present within them.
Note that while Emerson’s names (Early, Late, Post-Guodian)
are kept for convenience, they don’t necessarily have to indicate separation in
time – they could perhaps represent different oral traditions, or sayings that
originally developed in different regions of China, which combined to form the
Dao De Jing we know today.  Also note that the Guodian document (~300 BCE)
consists of chapters from both Early and Late in roughly equal numbers, so this
“layering” actually happened very early.
Although chapter 40 was identified as being strongly
Post-Guodian, it is present in the Guodian manuscript, but that is not
considered a major problem. For example, if perhaps the post-Guodian “style”
was already being developed at the time the Guodian document was created, then
the presence of chapter 40 in the document could mean that it had already been
written in this style, perhaps shortly before the Guodian document was created,
whereas chapters 68-81 had yet to be written (or the Guodian compiler was not
aware of their existence).  There are probably many other scenarios that
could explain such a result.
Chapter 2 was variously classified as belonging to all three
layers, but the symbol distributions (below) simultaneously indicated that it
cannot belong to any of them!  If any chapter is truly a mixture of
layers, it is this one (which Emerson agrees with), so it is not assigned to
any.
With the chapters separated as given above, it is possible
to identify which symbols are used more often in one layer than another, as
shown in the table below.  Each line represents one symbol, and shows its
various English meanings (as used in this translation).  “Weak” symbols
show up three to six times more often in the indicated layer than the other
two, while “Strong” symbols show up more than six times more often. 
Within these sections, symbols are ordered from the least unbalanced to most
unbalanced distributions between the layers.  “Unique” symbols show up
only
in that layer, and not even once in the others.  In these sections, words
are listed from fewest appearances to most appearances.  Weak and Strong
symbols must show up in at least five chapters to be included, while Unique
symbols must be in at least three chapters.  Phrases (two or more symbols)
are shown in italics.  Some punctuation symbols are included as they tend
to show differences in grammatical conventions between the layers.  Where
two symbols are consistently translated into the same punctuation, (#1) and
(#2) are used to distinguish between them.

The symbol for “die, death” that is strongly Post-Guodian is
in only one non-Post-Guodian chapter (6, where the “spirit of the valley does
not die”).  All of the other 17 times (!) it is used is in Post-Guodian
chapters, so if it wasn’t for the one use in chapter 6, this symbol would be
strongly unique to the Post-Guodian chapters.
Symbols that show up much more often in two layers but
rarely in the other one are presented in the table on the following page, in the
same format as the previous one.  Symbols in the “Never” sections appear
about equally often in the other two layers, but not once in the indicated
layer.
“Dao” is
almost
three times more likely to appear in
Early and Late than Post-Guodian (and there almost always as “Dao of”), but not
quite enough to make it into the following table (under “Rarely in

Besides the symbol distributions, it is interesting to note
that of the six chapters in which the majority of the sources are
anti-Confucian, all but chapter 33 are Late (and it is Post-Guodian) – thus
none of the Early chapters are anti-Confucian.   Also, the
anti-military chapters (30, 31) are Early, while the chapters offering military
advice (68, 69) are Post-Guodian.   Finally, “living for the
substance” is a good thing in chapter 38 (Late), but a bad thing in chapters 50
and 75 (both Post-Guodian).
Early chapters are more concerned with heaven and earth,
images of the feminine and the child, the concepts of “without-name” and “no
danger”, and are the only chapters that try to describe Dao (1, 4, 14, 21, 25,
32, 34, 35), while they have little to do with the sage (only twice using “thus
the sage” in 30 chapters), governing the nation, easy vs. difficult, and never
mention the concept of “not striving”.
Late chapters have more Confucian terms, advice on how to
rule, and talk about non-interference, but at the same time are the only ones
that talk about possessing or “taking hold of” the world or the nation.
Post-Guodian chapters also offer some advice on how to rule,
tend to deal with hard/soft/weak/strong, are the only chapters that offer
military advice, and talk a lot about death, but rarely mention Dao or De, and
never mention the feminine, the child, emptiness, or the uncarved block.
The rest of the appendix collects all the chapters of each layer
together, so the reader can see their common themes.  The final section is
called “What Would the Sage Do?”, and collects every reference to the Sage from
the entire document.

EARLY
One
The Dao that can be spoken of
is not the ever-constant
Dao.
The name that can be named is
not the ever-constant
name.
That which is without-name is
the beginning of heaven
and earth.
That which possesses a name
is the mother of the ten
thousand creatures.
Therefore : always
without-desire, thus you observe its
subtle mystery.
Always possessing desires,
thus you observe its external
appearances.
These two, they arise from
the same source but have
different names;
This sameness is called their
deep mystery.
Deep mysteries, and again
deep mysteries –
The gateway of many subtle
mysteries.
Four
Dao is like a cup or bowl,
yet use it and there exists no
need to fill it.
Profound and deep!, it
appears to be the ancestor of the
ten thousand creatures.
It blunts their sharpness,
Loosens their tangles,
Softens their brightness,
Makes them the same as the
dust of the world.
Deep and profound!, it seems
to barely exist.
I do not know whose child it
is –
Its image came before that of
god.
Five
Heaven and earth are not kind
–
Thus the ten thousand
creatures become as straw dogs to
them.
The sage is not kind –
Thus the 100 families become
as straw dogs to him.
The space between heaven and
earth,
How is it just like a bellows
or flute?
It is empty, yet does not run
out.
The more it moves, and the
more it produces.
Too much talking is
exceptionally exhausting,
Which is not as good as
maintaining what is within.
Six
The spirit of the valley does
not die –
It is called the deep and mysterious
feminine.
The gateway of this deep and
mysterious feminine –
It is called the source of
heaven and earth.
Unbroken, it seems to exist.
Using it takes no effort.
Seven
Heaven is eternal, earth is
enduring.
The reason that heaven and
earth can be eternal and
enduring
Is because they do not live
for themselves.
Therefore they can live
forever.
Thus the sage :
Puts his self behind others,
yet finds his self before them.
Considers his self extraneous,
yet his self survives.
Is this not because he has no
self-interests?
Therefore he can achieve his
self-interests.
Nine
Holding and filling it
Are not as good as your
stopping short.
Hammering and sharpening it
Can not be forever maintained.
When gold and jade fill a
room,
There is no one who can
protect it.
To have wealth and high rank,
but with arrogance –
Then naturally their loss is
your own fault.
When the task is successful,
the self should let go of
it.
This is the Way of heaven.
Ten
Carrying and managing a body
while embracing the One,
Are you able to not separate
them?
Concentrating your Qi to
become soft,
Are you able to be like a
newborn infant?
Cleansing and clearing your
deep and mysterious
perception,
Are you able to be without
blemish?
Loving the citizens and
governing the nation,
Are you able to use
non-action?
Opening and closing the
gateway of heaven,
Are you able to serve as the
feminine?
Attaining clear insight in
all directions,
Are you able to not use your
knowledge?
Creating them and raising
them,
Creating but not possessing,
Acting but not concerned with
the results,
Leading yet not governing –
This is called deep and
mysterious De.
Thirteen
Favor and disgrace seem
alarming.
High rank brings great
suffering if you have a self.
What is meant by “favor and
disgrace seem alarming”?
Favor makes you the inferior,
so gaining it seems
alarming.
Losing it also seems alarming.
This is what is meant by
“favor and disgrace seem
alarming”.
What is meant by “high rank
brings great suffering if
you have a self”?
I am the reason that I have
great suffering, I who act like
I have a self.
When I am without a self, how
could I have suffering?
Therefore : he who is high
ranking and uses his self to
serve the world –
It seems he can thus be
entrusted with the world!
He who is loving and uses his
self to serve the world –
It seems he can thus be
entrusted with the world!
Fourteen
Look, it is not seen; its
name is called elusive.
Listen, it is not heard; its
name is called tenuous.
Grasp, it is not gotten; its
name is called subtle and
obscure.
These three things can not be
investigated any further –
Therefore they blend and
become one.
This one thing :
Its highest point is not
bright;
Its lowest point is not dark.
Continuous and unending!, it
can not be named;
It returns to non-existence.
It is called the form of that
which is without-form;
The image of non-existence.
It is called confusing and
indistinct.
Meet it and you do not see
its beginning;
Follow it and you do not see
its end.
Hold fast to the Way of the
ancients
In order to master the
present moment.
The ability to know the
ancient beginning –
This is called the main
principle of Dao.
Fifteen
The virtue of the ancients
made they who were scholars
subtle, mysterious, obscure, deep, and penetrating.
Their mysterious depths can
not be understood.
Now : only because they can
not be understood,
Therefore we try to emulate
their appearance :
Hesitant!, as if crossing a
winter stream.
Wary!, as if afraid of their
neighbors all around.
Respectful!, they are like a
visiting guest.
Yielding!, like ice that is
about to to break off.
Honest and genuine!, they are
like the uncarved block.
Wide and open!, they are like
a valley.
Unclear!, they are like muddy
water.
Who can take muddy water and
use stillness to slowly and
gently make it pure and clear?
Who can take what is tranquil
and use continual movement
to slowly and gently bring it to life?
He who maintains this Way
does not desire to be full.
Now : only because he is not
full,
Thus he can be hidden and
unfinished.
Sixteen
Attain the utmost emptiness.
Maintain a profound
stillness.
The ten thousand creatures
arise in unison,
And thus I observe their
return.
Now : all the myriad
creatures return to their source.
Returning to the source
speaks of stillness.
Stillness is called returning
to the natural order.
Returning to the natural
order speaks of the
ever-constant.
Knowing the ever-constant
speaks of insight.
Not knowing the ever-constant
is foolish and creates
misfortune.
Knowing the ever-constant
leads to tolerance.
Being tolerant leads to being
just and unbiased.
Being just and unbiased leads
to being kingly.
Being kingly leads to heaven.
Heaven leads to Dao.
Dao leads to what endures.
When the self disappears,
there can be no danger.
Twenty
Renounce learning and be
without worry.
“Yes” together with “yeah” –
What is their mutual distance
or nearness?
Beautiful together with
ugliness –
What is their mutual distance
or similarity?
That which people fear, they
are not able to not fear.
How ridiculous! They are not
yet centered!
Everyone is very festive,
As if enjoying the Tai Lao
sacrifice,
As if climbing terraces in
the spring.
I alone am unmoved! –
Like one who has not yet
given any sign,
Like a newborn infant who
does not yet act like a baby.
Very tired and worn out!, as
if without a place to return
to.
Everyone all has more than
they need;
I alone seem to have lost
everything.
I have the heart/mind of a
foolish person, indeed!!
I am very mixed up and
confused!
Common people are very clear
and bright;
I alone seem confused.
Common people are very
observant and alert;
I alone am very gloomy and
depressed.
Tranquil!, they are like the
ocean;
I drift on the wind!, as if
without a place to rest.
Everyone all has a purpose;
I alone am stupid and stubborn, and appear mean and
shallow.
I alone am different compared
to other people,
And value the food of the
mother.
Twenty one
The greatest De is possible
only when Dao is followed.
The action of Dao on
creatures is just indistinct, just
confusing.
Confusing! and indistinct!,
within it exists image.
Indistinct! and confusing!,
within it exists things.
Obscure! and dark!, within it
exists essence.
Its essence is extremely real
and true.
Within it exists truth.
From the present reaching to
antiquity,
Its name has not departed –
Thus I observe the father of
the multitudes.
How do I thus know the father
of the multitudes is like
this?
By means of this.
Twenty three
Minimal words are naturally
so.
Therefore : strong winds do
not last the entire
morning,
Sudden rains do not last the
entire day.
Who makes these things? 
Heaven and earth.
Even heaven and earth can not
maintain them forever,
And so how much less can people?
Therefore : of those who
engage in Dao –
He who Daos is one with Dao.
He who Des is one with
De.
He who loses is one with the
loss.
For he who is one with
Dao,
Dao is also pleased to have
him.
For he who is one with De,
De is also pleased to have
him.
For he who is one with loss,
Loss is also pleased to have
him.
If you do not trust enough,
then you will not have
anyone’s trust.
Twenty four
He who stands on tiptoe does
not really stand.
He who stands astride can not
travel.
He who displays himself does
not have insight.
He who considers himself
correct does not distinguish
himself.
He who boasts about himself
is without merit.
He who brags about himself
does not endure.
He who lives in Dao –
Calls these leftover food and unnecessary behavior.
Creatures detest them, no matter what.
Therefore : he who possesses Dao does not live by them.
Twenty five
Something existed unformed
yet complete,
Before heaven and earth were created.
Silent!  Empty!
Standing alone, not changing.
It circulates everywhere, and causes no danger.
It can be considered the
mother of the world.
I do not know its name;
Its symbol is called Dao.
If I tried to make its name, I would call it great.
Being great speaks of departing.
Departing speaks of being remote.
Being remote speaks of
returning.
Dao is great,
Heaven is great,
Earth is great,
The king is also great.
Within the realm exist four that are great,
And the king resides as one of them!
People follow the earth.
The earth follows heaven.
Heaven follows Dao.
Dao follows what is naturally so.
Twenty eight
Know your maleness, but
maintain your femaleness.
Serve as a stream to the
world.
Serving as a stream to the
world,
The ever-constant De will not
depart,
Returning you to the state of
the newborn infant.
Know your brightness, but
maintain your darkness.
Serve as an example to the
world.
Serving as an example to the
world,
The ever-constant De will not
falter,
Returning you to the state of
the limitless.
Know your honor, but maintain
your disgrace.
Serve as a valley to the
world.
Serving as a valley to the
world,
The ever-constant De will
then be sufficient,
Returning you to the state of
the uncarved block.
When the uncarved block is
broken up, then it becomes
tools.
When the sage uses it, then
he becomes the senior
government official.
Therefore : the greatest
cutting does not divide.
Thirty
He who uses Dao to assist the
master of the people
Does not use weapons or
strength on the world,
For his troubles would likely
return –
In the dwelling places of
armies, thorns and brambles are
produced,
And so what is left behind a
great army must have a bad
year.
He who has virtue gets
results and stops.
He does not dare to take by
using strength.
He gets results, but never
brags.
Gets results, but never
boasts.
Gets results, but is not
arrogant.
Gets results, but only when
he has no choice.
Gets results, but never uses
strength.
When creatures are robust but
old,
This is called “not Dao”.
That which is “not Dao” has
an early finish.
Thirty one
Now : fine weapons, they are
not tools of good fortune.
Creatures detest them, no
matter what.
Therefore : he who possesses
Dao does not live by them.
When a noble man is in his
dwelling, then he honors the
left.
When he commands troops, then
he honors the right.
Weapons, they are not tools
of good fortune.
They are not the tools of a noble
man.
When he has no choice but to
use them,
To be calm and indifferent is
superior –
Never pleased, indeed!
And he who is pleased enjoys
killing people.
Now : he who enjoys killing
people
Can not get what he desires
from the world!
Therefore : in fortunate
affairs honor the left,
In unfortunate affairs honor
the right.
Thus the assistant general of
the army resides on the left,
The supreme general of the
army resides on the right.
Thus we say they are dwelling
at a funeral :
When many people are killed,
Then mourn and weep with
grief for them.
Victory in war thus means
they will dwell at a funeral.
Thirty two
Dao is ever-constantly
without-name.
Even though the concept of
the uncarved block seems
insignificant,
No one in the world can
conquer it.
If nobles and kings could
maintain it,
The ten thousand creatures
would naturally obey.
Heaven and earth would join
with each other,
Thus dropping a sweet dew.
There are no citizens who
would make this happen,
Yet it would be naturally
fair and impartial.
And so, begin to divide and
you have names.
Once names exist,
Men should also be ready to
know when to stop.
Knowing when to stop is the
reason that there is no
danger.
An analogy for the action of Dao
in the world :
It is similar to a stream in
a valley that becomes part of a
large river or ocean.
Thirty four
Great Dao is like a vast
flood!
It is able to flow left and
right.
The ten thousand creatures
depend on it in order for life,
And are not rejected.
It accomplishes its tasks
successfully,
Yet does not possess a name.
It clothes and supports the
ten thousand creatures,
But does not act as their
master.
Therefore : since it is
ever-constantly without-desire,
It can then be named
insignificant.
Since the ten thousand
creatures return to it
But it does not act as their
master,
It can then be named great.
Thus the sage can achieve
greatness
Because he does not act
great.
Therefore he can achieve
greatness.
Thirty five
Holding fast to the great
image,
The entire world comes
towards you.
Comes towards you, and
meeting with no harm,
There is the greatest peace
and calm.
Music together with good food
make passing guests stay,
But Dao’s words are bland!
They are without flavor.
Look for it, there is not
enough to see.
Listen for it, there is not
enough to hear.
Use it, there is not enough
to exhaust.
Thirty seven
Dao ever-constantly resides
in non-action,
Yet nothing is left undone.
If nobles and kings could
maintain it,
The ten thousand creatures
would naturally transform.
Transform, and if desire
arises,
I would restrain it by means
of the nameless uncarved
block.
In the state of the nameless
uncarved block,
Men also would be
without-desire.
Not desiring, thus they would
be still –
And the world would naturally
settle.
Thirty nine
Of those who in ancient times
attained oneness :
Heaven attained oneness, thus
becoming pure and clear.
Earth attained oneness, thus
becoming stable.
Spirit attained oneness, thus
becoming potent.
The valley attained oneness,
thus becoming full.
The ten thousand creatures
attained oneness, thus
becoming alive.
Nobles and kings attained
oneness, thus serving the
world faithfully.
They attained it.
If heaven could not use its
purity and clarity,
I fear it would split apart.
If earth could not use its
stability,
I fear it would erupt.
If spirit could not use its
potency,
I fear it would cease to be.
If the valley could not use
its fullness,
I fear it would be used up.
If the ten thousand creatures
could not use their life,
I fear they would be
destroyed.
If nobles and kings could not
use their high rank and
prominence,
I fear they would fall.
Therefore : humility thus
serves as the source of high
rank;
Low thus serves as the
foundation of high.
Thus nobles and kings call
themselves orphaned, lonely,
and unlucky.
Does this not mean that
humility thus serves as the
source?
Does it not?
Therefore : to attain
exceptional popularity is to be
without popularity –
Do not desire to be scarce
like jade,
But common like rock.
Forty one
The superior scholar hearing
of Dao works hard and
practices it.
The average scholar hearing
of Dao seems to keep it,
seems to lose it.
The inferior scholar hearing
of Dao laughs greatly at it.
If he did not laugh, it would
not be qualified to be Dao.
Therefore : in the
established sayings that exist, it is
said –
Insight into Dao seems like
darkness.
Advancing in Dao seems like
retreating.
Smooth Dao seems knotted.
Superior De seems like a
valley.
The greatest purity seems
like disgrace.
The most extensive De seems
like it is not enough.
Established De seems aimless.
Real and true character seems
inconsistent.
The greatest region is
without borders.
The greatest vessel is last
to be completed.
The greatest tone is a
tenuous sound.
The greatest image is
without-form.
Dao is hidden and
without-name.
Now : only Dao is good at
beginning and also good at
completing.
Forty four
Fame and self : which do you
love?
Self and property : which is
greater?
Gain and loss : which is the
affliction?
Extreme desire must lead to
great expense.
Collecting too much must lead
to substantial loss.
Knowing when you have enough,
there can be no
disgrace.
Knowing when to stop, there
can be no danger.
Then you can forever endure.
Fifty one
Dao creates them,
De raises them,
Things shape them,
Circumstances complete them.
Thus among the ten thousand
creatures,
There are none who do not
respect Dao and honor De.
Respect of Dao,
Honor of De –
Now : there is no one who
commands this,
Yet it is always naturally
so.
Therefore : Dao creates them,
De raises them.
Leads them, nourishes them,
Shelters them, heals 
them,
Supports them, protects them.
Creating but not possessing,
Acting but not concerned with
the results,
Leading yet not governing –
This is called deep and
mysterious De.
Fifty two
The world had a beginning,
Which can be considered the
mother of the world.
Once you have realized its
mother,
You thus know her children.
Once you know her children,
Return to and maintain their
mother.
When the self disappears,
there can be no danger.
Block your senses, close your
gateway –
All your life you will not
struggle.
Open your senses, be
successful in your duties –
All your life you will not
have relief.
Seeing the insignificant
speaks of insight.
Maintaining softness speaks
of strength.
Use your brightness to return
to your insight.
Do not lose your self in
misfortune.
This is called practicing the
ever-constant.
Fifty five
He who embodies the substance
of De
Can be compared to a newborn
child :
Wasps, scorpions, snakes, and
serpents do not sting him,
Fierce beasts do not seize
him,
Birds of prey do not claw
him.
His bones are weak, his
muscles are soft, yet his grasp is
firm and strong.
He has not yet known the
union of female and male, yet
his penis rises.
He has the utmost essence,
indeed!
He cries the entire day yet
does not get hoarse.
He has the utmost harmony,
indeed!
Knowing harmony speaks of the
ever-constant.
Knowing the ever-constant
speaks of insight.
Benefitting life speaks of
good fortune.
Heart/mind making Qi speaks
of strength.
When creatures are robust but
old,
We call them “not Dao”.
That which is “not Dao” has
an early finish.
Fifty six
He who knows does not speak;
He who speaks does not know.
Block your senses, close your
gateway.
Blunt your sharpness,
Loosen your tangles,
Soften your brightness,
Be the same as the dust of
the world.
This is called a deep and
mysterious sameness.
Therefore : you can not gain
it and be friendly,
Can not gain it and be
unfriendly,
Can not gain it and benefit,
Can not gain it and cause
harm,
Can not gain it and have high
rank,
Can not gain it and be lowly.
Therefore you become valuable
to the world.
LATE
Three
Not honoring those who are
esteemable
Ensures that the citizens do
not strive.
Not valuing rare goods
Ensures that the citizens do
not act like thieves.
Not showing that which can be
desired
Ensures that the citizens’
heart/minds do not become
confused.
Thus the governing of the
sage
Empties their heart/minds,
fills their stomachs,
Weakens their ambitions,
strengthens their bones.
By always ensuring that the
citizens are
without-knowledge and without-desire,
Those who make men wise will
not dare to act.
Act with non-action, then all
will be governed!
Eight
The highest virtue is like
water –
Water’s virtue benefits the
ten thousand creatures, yet it
does not strive.
It dwells in places that
everyone detests,
Therefore it is almost
comparable to Dao!
In dwelling, the virtue is in
the land.
In your heart/mind, the
virtue is in being profound and
deep.
In relations, the virtue is
in being kind.
In speech, the virtue is in
being truthful.
In governing, the virtue is
in being honest and just.
In your duties, the virtue is
in being competent.
In action, the virtue is in
the timing.
Now : only because there is
no striving,
Therefore there is no blame.
Twelve
The five colors can make
people’s eyes blind.
The five tones can make
people’s ears deaf.
The five flavors can make
people’s mouths dull.
Excessive hunting and horse
racing can make people’s
heart/minds become wild.
Rare goods can make people’s
behavior corrupt.
Thus the sage :
Acts on what is inside, he
does not act on what he sees.
Therefore he leaves that and
chooses this.
Seventeen
The existence of the best
ruler is barely known to the
people.
Next is one who they love and
praise.
Next is one who they fear.
Next is one who they
ridicule.
If the ruler does not trust
enough, then he will not have
anyone’s trust.
Thoughtful!, he values his
words.
When tasks are accomplished
and duties are successful,
The 100 families all say “we
are naturally so”.
Eighteen
When the great Dao is
abandoned,
There exists kindness and
morality.
When intelligence and wisdom
arise,
There exists a great deal of
deception.
When the six relationships
are not in harmony,
There exists devoted children
and loving parents.
When the nation and the families
are very confused,
There exists loyal officials.
Nineteen
Renounce sacredness, abandon
wisdom,
And the citizens benefit
100-fold.
Renounce kindness, abandon
morality,
And the citizens return to
being devoted children and
loving parents.
Renounce cleverness, abandon
profit,
And thieves and bandits will
not exist.
These three things thus make
a civilized society, but are
not enough.
Therefore : to ensure the
citizens have a place to belong–
See the simplicity,
Embrace the concept of the
uncarved block,
Less selfishness,
Fewer desires.
Twenty two
What is wrong then becomes
whole and perfect.
What is bent then becomes
straight.
What is hollow then becomes
filled.
What is worn out then becomes
new.
Have little, then gain.
Have too much, then become
confused.
Thus the sage :
Embraces the One, thus
serving as an example to the
world –
He does not display himself,
therefore he has insight.
Does not consider himself
correct, therefore he
distinguishes himself.
Does not boast about himself,
therefore he possesses
merit.
Does not brag about himself,
therefore he endures.
Now : only because he does
not strive,
Therefore no one in the world
can strive against him.
That which the ancients say :
“He who is wrong then becomes
whole and perfect” –
How can these be empty words?
Be truly whole and perfect,
and return to it.
Twenty seven
A good traveler is without
wagon track or footprint.
A good speaker is without
flaw or disgrace.
A good accountant does not
use counting tokens.
A good barrier is without bar
or lock, yet can not be
opened.
A good binding is without
cord or restraint, yet can not
be loosened.
Thus the sage :
Is always good at helping
people,
Therefore he does not abandon
people.
Is always good at helping
creatures,
Therefore he does not abandon
creatures.
This is called following your
insight.
Therefore : he who is a
virtuous person is the teacher of
he who is not a virtuous person.
He who is not a virtuous
person is the resource of he
who is a virtuous person.
If the latter does not value
his teacher,
Or the former does not love
his resource,
Even if there is wisdom,
there will be great confusion.
This is called the essential
subtle mystery.
Twenty nine
Would you take hold of the
world and control it?
I see you have no choice.
Now : the world is a divine
vessel,
You can not control it
(indeed!).
He who acts, ruins it;
He who grasps, loses it.
Therefore : creatures are
Sometimes active, sometimes
passive,
Sometimes breathe heavy,
sometimes breathe easy,
Sometimes strong, sometimes
weak,
Sometimes oppressed,
sometimes overthrown.
Thus the sage :
Removes the extremes,
Removes the extravagant and
wasteful,
Removes the arrogance.
Thirty eight
A man of highest De does not
use his De, thus he
possesses De.
A man of inferior De does not
lose his De, thus he is
without De.
A man of highest De uses
non-action, and acts without
motive.
A man of inferior De coerces
others, and has a motive to
act.
A man of highest kindness
coerces others, and acts
without motive.
A man of highest morality
coerces others, and has a
motive to act.
A man of highest propriety
coerces others, and if there
is no one who responds,
Then he rolls up his sleeves
and keeps doing it.
Therefore : lose Dao, and
later comes De.
Lose De, and later comes
kindness.
Lose kindness, and later
comes morality.
Lose morality, and later
comes propriety.
Now : propriety is that which
is merely the appearance
of loyalty and honesty,
And the beginning of
confusion.
He who is ahead in knowledge
has the flower of Dao,
But the beginning of
stupidity and foolishness.
Thus the greatest elders :
Live by Dao’s substance, and
do not dwell on Dao’s
appearance.
Live on Dao’s fruit, and do
not dwell on Dao’s
flower.
Therefore they leave that and
choose this.
Forty five
Great achievement seems
incomplete,
But its usefulness is not
impaired.
Great fullness is like a cup
or bowl,
Its usefulness is not
exhausted.
Great straightness seems
bent.
Great skillfulness seems
clumsy.
Great debaters seem slow of speech.
Restlessness conquers cold.
Stillness conquers heat.
Purity and clarity along with
stillness makes the world
proper and correct.
Forty six
When the world possesses Dao,
Riding horses are nonetheless
used for manure.
When the world is without
Dao,
War-horses are bred in the
countryside.
There is no fault greater
than the capacity for desire.
There is no misfortune
greater than not knowing when
you have enough.
There is no error greater
than desire for gain.
Therefore : knowing the
sufficiency of having enough,
there is always enough!
Forty seven
You do not have to go out the
door
In order to to know the
world.
You do not have to look out
the window
In order to to know the Way
of
heaven.
The farther you go out,
You know even less.
Thus the sage :
Does not travel, yet knows.
Does not display himself, yet
has a reputation.
Does not act, yet
accomplishes.
Forty eight
The actions of those who
learn daily increase.
The actions of those who Dao
daily decrease.
Decreasing and again
decreasing,
In order to arrive at
non-action.
Use non-action, and nothing
is left undone.
To take hold of the world,
always use non-interference.
When you are compelled 
to interfere,
Then you are not qualified to
take hold of the world.
Forty nine
The sage does not have a
constant heart/mind,
Thus the 100 families’
heart/minds become his
heart/mind.
He who is virtuous, I am
virtuous to him.
He who is not virtuous, I am
also virtuous to him.
Because De is virtue.
He who is honest, I am honest
with him.
He who is not honest, I am
also honest with him.
Because De is honesty.
The sage lives in the world,
gathering it all in.
And so he serves the world,
merging with their
heart/minds.
The 100 families all pay
attention to their ears and eyes,
And the sage treats them all
like his children.
Fifty three
If I correctly use the
tiniest bit of knowledge that I
possess
While travelling on the great
Way,
It is only walking off the
path that I need to fear.
The great Way is extremely
even,
But the citizens are fond of
side paths.
Although the royal court is
very well-kept,
The fields are very overgrown
with weeds,
The granaries are very empty.
While at the court they wear
refined multicolored silks,
Carry sharp swords,
Stuff themselves with drink
and food,
And have an excess of wealth
and goods.
This is called robbery and
extravagance,
Not Dao, indeed!!
Fifty four
That which is well
established is not uprooted.
That which is well embraced
is not abandoned.
Thus children and
grandchildren offer sacrifices, and so
sacrifices do not stop.
Cultivate it in the self –
your De will then be true and
real.
Cultivate it in the family –
its De will then be more than
enough.
Cultivate it in the village –
its De will then last forever.
Cultivate it in the nation –
its De will then be abundant.
Cultivate it in the world –
its De will then be everywhere.
Therefore : use your self to
contemplate the self.
Use your family to
contemplate the family.
Use your village to
contemplate the village.
Use your nation to
contemplate the nation.
Use the world to contemplate
the world.
How do I thus know the world
is like this?
By means of this.
Fifty seven
Use honesty and justness when
governing a nation.
Use strange and unusual
tactics when commanding
troops.
Use non-interference to take
hold of the world.
How do I thus know it is like
this?
By means of this :
The world has many
prohibitions and taboos,
And the citizens become even
poorer.
The citizens have many sharp
tools,
And the nation and the
families grow in confusion.
The people have too much
knowledge and cleverness,
And strange things begin to
increase.
Matters of law are
increasingly proclaimed,
And more thieves and bandits
exist.
Therefore : the sage says –
I use non-action, and the
citizens naturally transform.
I cherish stillness, and the
citizens naturally become
honest and just.
I use non-interference, and
the citizens naturally become
wealthy.
I am without-desire, and the
citizens naturally return to
the state of the uncarved block.
Fifty eight
If their government is very
restrained,
Its citizens will be very
genuine and honest.
If their government is very
observant and alert,
Its citizens will be very
lacking and deficient.
Misfortune! is that which
good fortune leans on.
Good fortune! is that which
misfortune lies on.
Who knows their limits?
They are not honest and just.
Honesty and justness returns,
becoming strange and
unusual.
Virtue returns, becoming
weird and strange.
The confusion of the people –
Its days have indeed been
everlasting.
Thus the sage :
Is honest and does not
divide,
Is honorable and does not
injure,
Is straightforward and does
not indulge in excess,
Is bright but does not
dazzle.
Fifty nine
When governing people or
doing heaven’s duties,
It is better to be sparing.
Now : only when you can be
sparing,
This is called early
acceptance.
Early acceptance is called
doubling your accumulation
of De.
With a double accumulation of
De,
Then everything can be
overcome.
When everything can be
overcome,
Then no one knows your
limits.
When no one knows your
limits,
You can possess the nation.
Possessing the mother of the
nation,
You can forever endure.
This is called having a deep
source and a firm
foundation,
The Way of long life and
enduring sight.
Sixty
Governing a great nation is
like cooking a small fish.
Because Dao is present in the
world,
Its ghosts do not have
spirit.
Not that its ghosts do not
have any spirit,
But their spirit does not
injure people.
Not only does their spirit
not injure people,
The sage also does not injure
people.
Now : since these two do not
injure each other,
Therefore their De merges and
returns!
Sixty one
A great nation is like the
lowest places water can flow –
The merging place of the
world,
The female of the world.
The female always uses
stillness to conquer the male.
By using stillness, she
becomes lower-than.
Therefore : if a great nation
is lower-than a small nation,
Then it takes hold of the
small nation.
If a small nation is
lower-than a great nation,
Then it is taken hold of by
the great nation.
Therefore : sometimes one
nation is lower-than in order
to take hold of,
Sometimes one nation is
lower-than and then it is taken
hold of.
A great nation merely desires
to combine livestock and
people,
A small nation merely desires
to get work for its people.
Now : for both nations to
each get that which is their
desire,
It is proper for the great
nation to be lower-than.
Sixty two
That which Daos is the
obscure mystery of the ten
thousand creatures.
This is the treasure of a
virtuous person,
And that which is the
protection of a person who is not
virtuous.
Beautiful speech can be used
in the market,
Respectful behavior can
benefit people.
People who are not virtuous,
Why abandon them?
Therefore : when inaugurating
the son of heaven,
Or installing the three
nobles –
Even if you possessed jade
disks drawn by a team of
four
horses,
That is not as good as
sitting and offering this Way.
What was the ancients’ reason
that they valued this Way?
Did they not say :
Seek in order to obtain,
Have faults in order to be
forgiven?
Therefore Dao becomes
valuable to the world.
Sixty three
Act with non-action.
Handle duties with
non-interference.
Taste that which is
without-flavor.
Greatness is insignificant,
too much is less.
Repay animosity with De.
Plan for the difficult while
it is easy.
Act on the great while it is
tiny.
In the world, difficult duties
certainly start while easy.
In the world, great duties
certainly start while tiny.
Thus the sage in the end does
not act great,
Therefore he can achieve his
greatness.
Men who make promises
lightly, certainly few will trust.
Men who expect most duties to
be easy will certainly
have many difficulties.
Thus the sage plans for
things to be difficult,
Therefore in the end he is
without difficulty!
Sixty four
What is peaceful is easy to
hold.
What has not yet been
revealed is easy to plan for.
What is brittle is easy to
shatter.
What is minute is easy to
scatter.
Act on it while it does not
yet exist.
Govern them while they are
not yet confused.
A tree too big to embrace is
created from the tiniest
shoot.
A terrace of nine stories
rises from a pile of dirt.
A journey of a thousand miles
begins from under the feet.
He who acts, ruins it.
He who grasps, loses it.
Thus the sage :
Does not act, therefore he
does not ruin.
Does not grasp, therefore he
does not lose.
Citizens are always on the
verge of achieving their
undertakings, yet they ruin them.
Be as careful in the end as
if it was the beginning,
Then you will not ruin your
affairs.
Thus the sage :
Desires to not desire,
Does not value rare goods,
Learns to not learn.
He returns to that which
everyone else has passed over,
Thus helping the ten thousand
creatures to be naturally
so,
Yet not daring to act.
Sixty five
The virtue of the ancients
(they who acted in Dao),
Did not use it to enlighten
the citizens,
But would have used it to
keep them ignorant –
The citizens are hard to
govern
Because they have too much
knowledge.
Therefore : using knowledge
to govern the nation
Is the bane of the nation.
Not using knowledge to govern
the nation
Is the good fortune of the
nation.
He who has knowledge of these
two also has them as
examples.
To always understand these
examples –
This is called deep and
mysterious De.
Deep and mysterious De is so
profound! and remote!
That when creatures return,
it returns with them!
Then they reach the greatest
harmony.
Sixty six
The reason that rivers and
seas can act as kings of the
100 valleys
Is because they are good at being
lower-than them.
Therefore : they can act as
kings of the 100 valleys.
Thus the sage :
In desiring to be above the
citizens,
He must by means of his
speech be lower-than them.
In desiring to be before the
citizens,
He must by means of his self
be behind them.
Thus the sage :
Lives above them, but the
citizens are not burdened.
Lives in front of them, but
the citizens are not harmed.
Thus the world is pleased to
promote him, and does not
tire of him.
Because he does not strive,
Therefore no one in the world
can strive against him.
POST-GUODIAN
Eleven
Thirty spokes of a wheel
share one hub;
In its emptiness exists the
usefulness of the cart.
Mix water with clay thus
making a vessel;
In its emptiness exists the
usefulness of the vessel.
Cut out doors and windows
thus making a room;
In their emptiness exists the
usefulness of the room.
Therefore : what exists thus
makes a thing profitable;
Emptiness thus makes it
useful.
Twenty six
Serious
serves as the source of frivolous.
Stillness serves as the ruler of restlessness.
Thus the noble man travels
the entire day,
And does not stray from his
wagon.
He is serious, even though
glorious sights and feasts
exist;
He
lives above them, like this.
So how could one be the
master of ten thousand chariots,
And conduct his self
frivolously in the world?
Be frivolous, then lose the
source.
Be restless, then lose the rulership.
Thirty three
He who knows people is wise;
He who knows himself has
insight.
He who is victorious over
people possesses power;
He who is victorious over
himself is strong.
He who knows he has enough is
wealthy;
He who uses force possesses
ambition.
He who does not lose his
place endures;
He who dies yet does not
perish has longevity.
Thirty six
When you are about to gather
something,
You must have originally
spread it out.
When you are about to weaken
something,
You must have originally
strengthened it.
When you are about to abandon
something,
You must have originally been
interested in it.
When you are about to seize
something,
You must have originally
given it.
This is called subtle and
obscure insight.
What is soft and weak
conquers what is hard and strong.
Fish can not escape from the
deep;
The sharp tools of the nation
Can not be shown to the
people.
Forty
The movement of Dao returns
things.
The function of Dao is to
weaken things.
The ten thousand creatures of
the world are created from
being;
Being is created from
non-being.
Forty two
Dao creates one.
One creates two.
Two creates three.
Three creates the ten
thousand creatures.
The ten thousand creatures
carry Yin and embrace Yang,
Pouring their Qi together,
thus becoming harmonious.
That which people detest :
Being alone, orphaned,
lonely, and unlucky –
Yet kings and nobles thus
name themselves.
Therefore : creatures
Sometimes lose, yet they
gain;
Sometimes gain, yet they
lose.
That which people teach, I
also teach :
Those who are bullies and
hoodlums do not meet their
natural death.
I will thus become their
elder teacher.
Forty three
The softest things of the
world
Overrun the hardest things of
the world.
Non-being can enter where
there is no space in between.
Thus I know that non-action
has benefits.
The teaching of no-talking,
The benefit of non-action –
Few in the world attain
these.
Fifty
Between coming out into life
and entering death,
Followers of life are 3 in
10.
Followers of death are 3 in 10.
People whose lives are merely
moving them towards the
place of death
Are also 3 in 10.
Now : what is the reason?
Because they live life for
its substance.
But I have heard that he who
is skilled at taking in life
Can travel the mountains and
does not meet rhino or
tiger,
Can enter a battle not
wearing armor or weapons.
The rhino has no place to
thrust its horns,
The tiger has no place to use
its claws,
The weapon has no place to
allow its blade.
Now : what is the reason?
Because for him there is no
place of death.
Sixty seven
In the world, all say I am
great,
But do not seem to be like
everyone else.
Now : only because I am
not  like everyone else,
therefore I can be great.
If I was like everyone else,
Long ago! I would have become
insignificant, indeed!
Now :  I possess three
treasures –
Hold and maintain them.
The first is called
compassion,
The second is called economy,
The third is called not
daring to act first in the world.
With compassion, you can
therefore be brave.
With economy, you can
therefore expand.
By not daring to act first in
the world,
Therefore you can achieve the
capacity for leadership.
At present, people abandon
compassion but also try to be
brave,
Abandon economy but also try
to expand,
Abandon being behind but also
try to be first –
This is death!
Now : when compassion is used
in war, the consequence
is victory.
When it is used for
protection, the consequence is
strength.
When heaven would help you,
Using compassion it protects
you.
Sixty eight
He who is good at being a
scholar is not militant.
He who is good at war does
not get angry.
He who is good at conquering
the enemy does not
engage them.
He who is good at making use
of people acts lower-than
them.
This is called the De of not
striving.
This is called the power of
making use of people.
This is called joining the
elite of heaven’s ancients,
indeed!
Sixty nine
Those who command troops have
a saying :
I dare not act like the
master, but instead act like a guest.
Dare not advance an inch, but
instead retreat a foot.
This is called marching
without marching,
Seizing without using your
arms,
Routing without having an
enemy,
Defending without using
weapons.
There is no misfortune
greater than underestimating the
enemy.
By underestimating the enemy,
I nearly lose my
treasures.
Therefore : when armies on
opposing sides are evenly
matched,
Then they who mourn will be
victorious!
Seventy
My words are very easy to
understand,
Very easy to practice.
But there is no one in the
world who can understand
them,
There is no one who can
practice them.
My words possess a lineage,
My duties possess a ruler.
Now : only because I am
without-knowledge,
Thus I am not understood.
Those who understand me are
rare,
Consequently I am one who is
valued!
Thus the sage wears coarse
cloth, but carries jade in his
heart.
Seventy one
Knowing that you do not know
is honorable!
Not knowing that you know is
a sickness!
Now : only when you are sick
of sickness,
Thus you are not sick.
The sage is not sick
Because he is sick of
sickness.
Thus he is not sick.
Seventy two
If the citizens do not fear
your authority,
Then a greater authority will
arrive!
Do not disrespect their
dwellings,
Do not despise their
livelihood.
Now : only because you do not
despise them,
Thus they will not tire of
you.
Thus the sage :
Knows himself but not display
himself,
Loves himself but does not
exalt himself.
Therefore he leaves that and
chooses this.
Seventy three
When your courage lies in
daring,
The consequence is killing.
When your courage lies in not
daring,
The consequence is survival.
These two choices, they
sometimes cause benefit,
sometimes cause harm.
That which heaven detests –
who knows its reasons?
The Way of heaven :
Does not strive, yet
skillfully achieves its goals.
Does not speak, yet
skillfully responds.
Does not summon, yet everything
naturally comes to it.
Is certainly unhurried, yet
skillfully prepares.
Heaven’s net is extremely
vast;
It is wide meshed, yet does
not fail.
Seventy four
If the citizens do not fear
death,
How can you use death to
frighten them?
Assuming you could ensure
that the citizens always fear
death,
And I get hold of those who
act strange and unusual and
kill them,
Then who would be daring?
There will always exist an
executioner.
Now : to take the place of
the executioner to do the
killing,
This is called taking the
place of a great craftsman to
carve wood.
Now : of those who take the
place of a great craftsman to
carve wood,
Few will not injure their
hand!
Seventy five
The citizens are hungry
Because their superiors eat
too much of their taxes.
Thus they are hungry.
The citizens are hard to
govern
Because their superiors are
compelled to take action.
Thus they are hard to govern.
The citizens take death
lightly
Because they seek the substance
of life.
Thus they take death lightly.
Now : only he who has no use
for being alive
Is virtuous compared to he
who values living.
Seventy six
The people are born (indeed!)
soft and weak.
They die (indeed!) hard and
inflexible.
The ten thousand creatures,
the grass and trees, are born
(indeed!) soft and fragile.
They die (indeed!) dried and
withered.
Therefore : that which is
hard and inflexible is a follower
of death.
That which is soft and weak
is a follower of life.
Thus if a weapon is
inflexible, the consequence is defeat.
If a tree is inflexible, then
it snaps.
Inflexible and great dwell
below.
Soft and weak dwell above.
Seventy seven
The Way of heaven, how it is
just like stretching a bow?
He who is high is pressed
down by it.
He who is low is lifted by
it.
He who has excess is reduced
by it.
He who does not have enough
is filled by it.
The Way of heaven
Reduces what has excess and
fills what does not have
enough.
The Way of people on the
other hand is not like this,
And takes from those who do
not have enough in order to
offer it to those who have too much.
Who can have too much and
offer it to the world?
Only he who possesses Dao.
Thus the sage :
Acts, but is not concerned
with the results.
Accomplishes his tasks, but
does not dwell on them.
He does not desire to display
his virtue.
Seventy eight
In the world, nothing is
softer and weaker than water.
Yet for attacking that which
is hard and strong,
There is nothing that can
surpass it.
This is because it endlessly
replaces itself.
Weakness conquers strength.
Softness conquers hardness.
In the world, there is no one
who does not know this,
But there is no one who can
practice it.
Thus the sage says :
Accepting upon oneself the
disgrace of the nation
Is called being master of the
shrines.
Accepting upon oneself the
misfortune of the nation
Is called being king of the
world.
Honest words seem contrary.
Seventy nine
Harmonize a great resentment,
And there must exist some
remaining resentment.
How can this be considered
good?
Thus the sage :
Holds the left side of an
agreement,
But does not demand payment
of people.
Therefore : to have De is to
take charge of your
agreements;
To be without De is to take
charge of taking away from
others.
The Way of heaven, while
without favor,
Is always with virtuous
people.
Eighty
In a small nation with few
citizens :
Ensure that it has the
weapons of ten nobles, but does not
use them.
Ensure that the citizens take
death seriously, and do not
migrate far.
Even though they have boats
and carriages, there is no
place to take advantage of them.
Even though they have armor
and weapons, there is no
place to display them.
Ensure that the citizens
return to knotting ropes and using
them,
Find deliciousness in their
food,
Beauty in their clothes,
Contentment in their
dwellings,
Happiness in their customs.
Although neighboring nations
overlook one another,
And sounds of roosters and
dogs can be heard in one
another –
The citizens reach old age
and die,
And do not come and go
between one another.
Eighty one
True words are not beautiful;
Beautiful words are not true.
He who has virtue does not
argue;
He who argues does not have
virtue.
He who knows is not learned;
He who is learned does not
know.
The sage does not accumulate
things –
Since through serving people,
the more one has;
Since through giving to
people, one has even more.
The Way of heaven benefits
and does not cause harm.
The Way of the sage acts yet
does not strive.
As mentioned above,
chapter 2 seems to be a truly “mongrel” chapter, with characteristics that
indicate it belongs to all three layers, and none of them.  Therefore, it
is presented here, separate from the other layers.
Two
In the world, when all know
that the action of beauty is
beautiful, then ugliness ensues.
When all know that the action
of good is goodness, then
not-good ensues.
Therefore : being and
non-being create each other,
Difficult and easy complete
each other,
Long and short contrast each
other,
High and low lean on each
other,
Tone and voice harmonize each
other,
Before and after follow each
other.
Thus the sage :
Lives by using non-action in
his duties,
And practicing no-talking in
his teachings.
The ten thousand creatures
arise, but do not have a
beginning.
Creating but not possessing;
Acting, but not concerned
with the results;
Accomplishing tasks, but not
dwelling on them.
Now : only because there is
no dwelling,
Thus the results do not
depart.
WHAT WOULD THE SAGE DO?
Thus the sage :
Lives by using non-action in
his duties,
And practicing no-talking in
his teachings.
Thus the governing of the
sage
Empties their heart/minds,
fills their bellies,
Weakens their ambitions,
strengthens their bones.
The sage is not kind;
Thus the 100 families become
as straw dogs to him.
Thus the sage :
Puts his self behind others,
yet finds his self before them.
Considers his self
extraneous, yet his self survives.
Is this not because he has no
self-interests?
Therefore he can achieve his
self-interests.
Thus the sage :
Acts on what is inside, he
does not act on what he sees.
Therefore he leaves that and
chooses this.
Thus the sage :
Embraces the One, thus
serving as an example to the
world –
He does not display himself,
therefore he has insight.
Does not consider himself
correct, therefore he
distinguishes himself.
Does not boast about himself,
therefore he possesses
merit.
Does not brag about himself,
therefore he endures.
Now : only because he does
not strive,
Therefore no one in the world
can strive against him.
Thus the sage :
Is always good at helping
people,
Therefore he does not abandon
people.
Is always good at helping
creatures,
Therefore he does not abandon
creatures.
This is called following your
insight.
Thus the sage :
Removes the extremes,
Removes the extravagant and
wasteful,
Removes the arrogance.
Thus the sage can achieve
greatness
Because he does not act
great.
Therefore he can achieve
greatness.
Thus the sage :
Does not travel, yet knows.
Does not display himself, yet
has a reputation.
Does not act, yet
accomplishes.
The sage does not have a
constant heart/mind,
Thus the 100 families’
heart/minds become his
heart/mind.
The sage lives in the world,
taking it all in.
And so he serves the world,
merging with their
heart/minds.
The 100 families all pay
attention to their ears and eyes,
And the sage treats them all
like his children.
Therefore : the sage says –
I use non-action, and the
citizens naturally transform.
I cherish stillness, and the
citizens naturally become
honest and just.
I use non-interference, and
the citizens naturally become
wealthy.
I am without-desire, and the
citizens naturally return to
the state of the uncarved block.
Thus the sage :
Is honest and does not
divide,
Is honorable and does not
injure,
Is straightforward and does
not indulge in excess,
Is bright but does not
dazzle.
The sage also does not injure
people.
Thus the sage in the end does
not act great,
Therefore he can achieve his
greatness.
Thus the sage plans for
things to be difficult,
Therefore in the end he is
without difficulty!
Thus the sage :
Does not act, therefore he
does not ruin.
Does not grasp, therefore he
does not lose.
Thus the sage :
Desires to not desire,
Does not value rare goods,
Learns to not learn.
Thus the sage :
In desiring to be above the
citizens,
He must by means of his
speech be lower-than them.
In desiring to be before the
citizens,
He must by means of his self be
behind them.
Thus the sage :
Lives above them, but the
citizens are not burdened.
Lives in front of them, but
the citizens are not harmed.
Thus the world is pleased to
promote him, and does not
tire of him.
Thus the sage wears coarse
cloth, but carries jade in his
heart.
The sage is not sick
Because he is sick of
sickness.
Thus he is not sick.
Thus the sage :
Knows himself but not display
himself,
Loves himself but does not
exalt himself.
Therefore he leaves that and
chooses this.
Thus the sage :
Acts, but is not concerned
with the results.
Accomplishes his tasks, but
does not dwell on them.
He does not desire to display
his virtue.
Thus the sage says :
Accepting upon oneself the
disgrace of the nation
Is called being master of the
shrines.
Accepting upon oneself the
misfortune of the nation
Is called being king of the
world.
Thus the sage :
Holds the left side of an
agreement,
But does not demand payment
of people.
The sage does not accumulate
things –
Since through serving people,
the more one has;
Since through giving to
people, one has even more.
The Way of the sage acts yet
does not strive.
